Why is that? If we look at test, Seattle public schools is not that bad. Sure in comparison too many school districts on the Eastside like Bellevue, Mercer Island, Kirkland, Redmond, and Sammamish they are not as good, but that to be expected considering that everyone who lives in the Eastside is a well-off techie.

If we were to compared [SPS](https://www.greatschools.org/washington/seattle/seattle-public-schools/) to say [Edmonds School District](https://www.greatschools.org/washington/lynnwood/edmonds-school-district/) Seattle public schools has about the same number of people people performing average or above average, however, Seattle public has significantly more people performing above average in comparison to Edmonds. This is pretty good if you were to compare it so something like [LAUSD](https://www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/los-angeles-unified-school-district/) where almost 50% of students aren't not evening meeting the statewide standards. (Frankly LAUSD is in a different state and the standards in California are higher, but my point still stands).

Most schools north of the Ship Canal or in Queen Anne / Magnolia seem to perform quite highly in terms in terms of test scores i.e. 9/10 or 10/10. 

It makes me wonder what's with the bad rap the SPS gets, which makes people say that you should avoid it or send your kids to private schools? Is it because of ""le wokeness,"" which frankly this is Washington state, even the Catholic schools here are ""woke."" If you want to avoid wokeness you would move to Idaho. It's like gay atheist who live in the deep south complain about the policies there, but I digress.

Could it also be something more underling since I heard a lot of people who didn't like the removal of the accelerate curriculum, which seems to be echoed by [this article](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/whos-doing-the-quiet-leaving-from-the-seattle-public-schools/). 

&gt;It’s not as if Seattle schools are cratering. In the just-released round of standardized test scores, Seattle schools scored 12 percentage points above the statewide average in reading, and 14 points above the state average in math. Any big urban school district in the nation would swoon for results like that.  
&gt;  
&gt;But countless parents wrote that standardized tests are only the floor. With advanced learning options taking a hit, it’s the ceiling that they say is being lowered.

It says many wealthy people were the ones moving out of SPS. John Hay Elementary on Queen Anne, which is 9/10 in test scores lost a whopping 20% of its students.

This seems to be a similar predicament facing SFUSD where despite overall it performing decently, its universal lottery is a huge turn-off.  I.e. you could be living in Ravenna where your local public school 4 blocks away is a 9/10, but you'll enrolled and bussed to like Rainier Valley where the schools are 3/10, so many parents at SFUSD simply leave or go to private school. 

Seattle doesn't have that issue however, and parents may choose to live in Seattle over the eastside because its closer to their job or like me, they like neighborhoods that have sidewalks which 90% of Mercer Island and like 60% of Bellevue, Kirkland, and Redmond lack.",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,278178,public,confidence,self,Are Seattle public schools as bad as people make them out to be?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/xp5oy6/are_seattle_public_schools_as_bad_as_people_make/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tipping just a fixed amount like $1 or $5 like Uber should be normalized.

Pricing here is ridiculous. The menu lists a plate for $4 but then you have to add the VAT and these moronic service tips of 20%.

Assuming it will take at least two seasons (how long the Seahawks spent in Montlake) for any construction, something is going to happen soon to get the budget ready.


With the Kingdome's debt only paid off in 2015, it won't be a hard sell to levy taxes on hotels, parking, our license plates, or more. The Seahawks are not moving to Kent while the Sounders aren't going to Tukwilla.


I bet we see a vote on a huge pre-World Cup package next year that includes a massive expansion and modernization of the current stadium with the whole north end (steps and even the Hawk's Nest), the south end where the garish platform for a truck sits under the 12th man flag, and suites on and off the field being totally redone.

The labor agreement under negotiation covers workers across 29 ports in California, Oregon, and Washington--impacting a huge amount of container traffic to and from Asia.


While the involved parties and the Department of Labor claim no disruption to operations, **shippers have already rerouted lines to the East and Gulf Coasts**... requiring more rail.


The union and the 70 terminal operators and ocean carriers represented in the negotiations by the PMA have agreed to a media blackout during the labor talks, but the Wall Street Journal and other media providers have information if you Google it.

I moved here 8 years ago when the city was rapidly growing &amp; changing. Lived in Fremont, Kitsap, and Sno Co. The city used to be fun to visit when I wasn’t living there, and the other county’s used to be peaceful. 

The crime &amp; drug crisis is out of control, as a single woman, there’s no feeling safe walking alone in the city anymore. Camping this Summer was a nightmare, it was just so busy everywhere and the traffic heading back into the city every weekend was so much heavier. The litter problem is disgusting. This used to be such a clean city &amp; state versus from where I moved from and now it looks like a garbage zone.  

Everything I used to love about living in WA is dying. Working in Ballard and having to be in the city is depressing. As someone who is trying to have a baby, i can’t see myself raising a child here. 

With the dwindling police force and increased crime sprees happening now, it will be interesting to see how fast this city shits the bed in the next 5 years. 

Everyone is so entitled too. Virtue signaling is at its all time high and no one is allowed to have an opinion and are extremely judgmental if your views aren’t left leaning. This city’s political environment (the ppl) create so much unnecessary anxiety. Everyone is so stressed and worried about every single issue and at what resolve. What has voting done. We’re one of the most progressive cities in the nation and nothing has gotten better for the unhoused. The community aid distribution doesn’t even make a dent. 

Aren’t these ideals supposed to better society. Isn’t voting for ppl who want fair wages &amp; increased budgets for homelessness supposed to improve the situation not make it worse. How has this city gotten better, it’s the most depressing thing to watch crash &amp; burn in under 10 years.

I’ve been living in the (east) Bay Area for 3 years and starting to think that it’s time to leave. The problem is I don’t know where we’d go. Considered Seattle / PNW and still wouldn’t rule it out but I worry that the grey and gloom would bring me down. Has anyone left the bay and have experiences to share? I’m completely at a loss of what to do. Job is remote so I am fortunate to be able to really live wherever within the US. 

What I don’t like about the bay: 
• Traffic, hate it 
• Crime, it’s bad 
• Cost of living, lol 

What we like about the bay:
• Climate is pretty perfect aside from the drought / lack of rain + wildfires 
• Job opportunities 
• Diversity 
• Access to nature; ocean, mountains, hiking, etc 


Some things that are important to us:
• Safety / low crime 
• Less traffic 😵‍💫
• Reasonable cost of living
• Access to airport (to visit family) 
• Close to mountains, rivers or ocean (aka the great outdoors) 
• Seasons or mild climate 
• Good for families / good schools

Would not consider:
• Harsh winters 
• Desert climate 

Some areas that seem intriguing:
•PNW but the weather 
• Boise, ID
• San Diego, CA

Granted, ""underpaid"" is a subjective adjective but it sure would help to know how much the teachers ***are*** paid so that a reasonable discussion can be had. Instead, the conversation goes something like this:

Person A: Everyone knows teachers are underpaid and have been since forever!

Person B: Actually, a very significant number of SPS teachers make &gt;$100,000/year - you can look up their salaries for yourself

Person C: Well I know teachers (or am a teacher) and that's a lie! it would take me (X number) of years before I see 100K!

Person A: That's propaganda, SPS bootlicker - teachers are underpaid!

But I think most people have an idea of what they consider a reasonable teacher salary. Fortunately, several posters have provided a link to the state of Washington database of educator's salaries, which is here: [Washington State K12 School Employee Salaries](https://fiscal.wa.gov/dvk12salaries.aspx). You an download the entire file as an Excel sheet for easy analysis. You should do that so you don't have to take the word of some internet rando! (i.e. me). Here is a little snapshot:

* SY2020-2021 is the most recent year of data available
* I filtered the set for the Seattle school district, and then again for all teaching roles with the exclusion of substitutes. This includes: Other Teacher, Secondary Teacher, Elem. Homeroom Teacher, Elem. Specialist Teacher.
* There are 3487 teachers in this list with a salary above $0 in 2020-2021. This n=3487 is my denominator for the percentage calculations that follow.
* **Salaries &gt; $100,000/year - 1336 teachers or 38.3% of the total**
* 75th percentile = $106,539, Average=$89,179, Median=$87,581, 25th percentile=$73,650. This means that 75% of teachers make more than $73,650/year. 92 teachers (2.6%) make &lt;$50,000/year
* These salaries are for a contracted 189 days of work. ([CBA for 2019-2024 SPS &amp; PASS](https://www.seattleschools.org/wp-content/uploads/sps/district/File/District/Departments/Human%20Resources/CBA/PASS%20Contract%202019-2024%20%2020190610%20Final%20with%20Signature.pdf))
* For reference, the City of Seattle provides a way to calculate median individual income for 2022. The [City of Seattle Office of Housing 2022 Income &amp; Rent Limits](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/Housing/PropertyManagers/IncomeRentLimits/Income-Rent-Limits.pdf) on page 6, helpfully notes that 90% of area median income = $81,520 which then calculates to $90,577/year.
* 1621 teachers (46.5%) currently make &gt;$90,577/year. 
* Per reporting, the ***minimum*** raise being discussed is 5.5%. SEA is asking for some undetermined amount beyond that. Using this 5.5% value: 1486 teachers (42.6%) will make &gt;$100,000/year next school year.

The least expensive place I could find, so far, was $1300/month (that's the discounted rate), and they still required you make at least 3x the rent in income.

This had got to be some kind of joke.

I have helped a lot of people from different native languages learn Arabic so I have an understanding of what obstacles you'll come across and how I can help you get past them. Methodology:

I usually give 3 types of lessons:

N.B. All the lessons are held online, and so it doesn't matter how far from each other we are!

1. Traditional Arabic lessons: This type of lesson is targeted at serious, long-term Arabic learners. This type follows the Al Kitaab Arabic as a foreign language program, which is the most commonly used textbook for teaching Arabic.
2. Egyptian dialect: This type of lesson is targeted at people who already have the basics of MSA and are looking at learning the Egyptian dialect. This type of lesson follows the Kallimni Arabi Language learning program published by the AUC Press.
3. Conversation Lessons: These lessons are aimed at those who want to practice their speaking skills. These lessons don't have a specific curriculum; we usually pick a few topics to discuss before the lesson and then talk about them in the lesson. These lessons are also accompanied with writing assignments because I believe that the two of them go together hand in hand.

This has financial backing from the government I believe. It's part of a belief of harm reduction where the idea is that addicts are harmed by getting poor quality drugs on the street and are ODing because of high tolerance. If the idea is to reduce the number of OD deaths from opioids, lets regulate and control fentanyl and give pharmapseutical grade fentanyl to the addicts under the supervision of a doctor/nurse. The idea is also that addicts, when they don't get a hit, go through withdrawal which is extremely painful. To avoid this pain, addicts always focus on getting the next hit. Thus, if we provide a place where they can do that, they will have some stability in their life and will then focus on stabilizing other parts of their life like their housing and employment situations. 

The doctor did not seem to really mention anything about them getting clean, but rather that if they keep coming to the doctor's office for fentanyl, knowing they will always be able to get their fix, then maybe in the future they will ween off it or take less. 

The podcast guest mentioned there is no clear evidence that this has been helpful or therapuetic in any way because the program is so new, and it doesn't get much funding from the total federal budget. However, there is a similar program down the street from this clinic for heroin, and apparently there is more positive evidence that this regulation of heroin has actually allowed users to stabilize their life (again, this doesn't necessarily mean getting clean).

I have spent so far in Seattle about 450 days. But this year(my first visit after 2020) was something special. I read Seattle reddits casually to stay in touch with my “second hone” and I knew about homeless problem. The situation in Seattle seemed better to me when walking on the streets, but I still felt threatened. I evaded some places because I did not feel secure(did not visit Cal anderson park where I went every year to play tennis) but It obviously did not help. On my last day I was walking on 5th ave(and pine) and some really angry homeless guy was running towards me, screaming, cursing and jumped at me, with fists forward hitting me in my chest and shoulder(I deflected his punch towards my face). In that very second I was thinking what to do, if to retaliate or just hope it will end soon. I just tried to dodge as fast as I can and go away. It worked but I dont think this is fine and fair. In my country I would just pacify him and then wait for police, but in Seattle? I have my theories what happened to my beloved city(“progressive” policies), but I assure you this is not progress, this is just mad max style city. I hope that Seattle will be repaired soon, or I and many others wont travel to this city again. I cant let my family to be threatened, because some people wanna feel mindful. Please do something about this. This is not normal in western world, this is some wet progressive anarchy utopia, that does not work and never did.Having laws and enforcing them create progressive society, not “feeling bad” for less fortunate.

i wanted to ask here because i figured people in the area would know better, since i cant really search by when a place opens on maps yelp or even this sub. both of our 21st bday are happening over our trip, and for her birthday she wants to hike mnt tacoma. her fav meal is breakfast so i want to surprise her with a spot before we get a car to drive to the mountain, but everywhere i find tho delicious looking doesnt open till 7, 8, or 9? in fewer words i was wondering if anyone knew good spots (ideally around pikes place area) that open at maybe 6am? or even 5 tho ik thats unlikely, so we can eat then hit the road since its a bit of a drive. a place that serves eggs/waffles would b awesome! only one i found on my own so far is the breakfast club but the reviews r mixed mostly im off put by the description of NRA shirts on the staff and blue lives matter flags in the place lol

beggers cant b choosers but a place where the staff might maybe help me put candles on her waffles or smth would b simply tops but im not counting on that bc ik not everyone would wanna do smth like that! but i work at a local coffee shop in dfw myself so ik theres some places that would do stuff like that, another reason i wanted to ask here since thats hard to ascertain from yelp

sry if this is long and i hope people dont mind me posting this here i just figured repetitive as ppl looking for recs maybe can be, this was the best place to ask this since there were a few specifics behind exactly what im looking for! since ik well be busy on our trip for me to try and locate this in the 4 days im gonna b there haha",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,276701,public,confidence,self,early breakfast spots in seattle?

The sun was shining and despite the constantly closed beach I still enjoyed sitting by the water watching the heron, a nearby family was on the beach sand playing. A nice quiet moment.

But then some big outboard motor boat with a tube starts pulling in towards the beach. The guy driving doesn’t bother killing the motor until the last second, scaring all the geese and wildlife away, sending waves crashing on everyone.

Two women hop out and walk off, the guy is now struggling in the water to keep his boat still because of his own waves. After a few moments of silent fuming I decide to just be direct and I walk towards the guy and just say:
 “hey man you know this isn’t a boat launch right?”
And he gives me that stupid look where I know he’s wondering why pretending not to hear this woman talking to him isn’t making me go away.
Then he finally says “the beach is closed.”
And I tell him “doesn’t matter. There’s plenty of boat launches right downstream. You can’t just use a beach as a boat launch.”
In his brilliant defense this guy just says something like, “that’s not true.”
At that point I realize I’d be disturbing the peace of patrons if I try arguing with this brick wall so I just say “yeah it is, look it up.” And left.

But like, I’m not incorrect am I? Idk if maybe the women that hopped off just needed a restroom and I get it but he definitely was still breaking rules right? 

Frankly I wouldn’t have bothered bitching if had tried killing the motor earlier, or been respectful of anyone around him, but I just feel like a lot of motorized boaters at lake Washington seem to act like there are no rules to the water ways and as someone who grew up river boating with a dad that always made me understand the rules because otherwise you get mowed down by barges, it just gobsmacks me how flippant some folks are. Not to mention disturbing wildlife seems like a pretty dick move. 

Am I off base here though?

I know this question might be asked a lot, but I swear I've been looking things up online and just wanted to clarify some things. I currently live in vancouver (WA) and want to move to Seattle / surrounding area. I make roughly 80k, and am single.

From what I've seen, this should be a comfortable amount if I'm renting an apartment right? I just have doubts because of some threads where I see people commenting that this is below the median (though when I tried to google this, it seems like the median is around 50-60k?), or that 100k is required to live *comfortably*, and that anything below 80k would be tight.

I'm not a very extravagant spender, my expenses are mainly food and cat supplies (and my FFXIV subscription). I do have to pay for car insurance though.

Apart from that, my current rent is nearly $1500 not including utilities and internet. It seems that I can find even cheaper rent in some areas (I haven't gone too deep into this research yet, but from a quick skim I can find studio apartments for $1300 or so, like at Eastlake).

But this might affect things a tiny bit. I am hoping to save enough to buy a condo in the area within the near future. It's a hopeful plan but with the prices I see on Redfin and Zillow, it's getting crushed every day lol, but a goal nonetheless.

I feel like if I were to be able to find a place with rent that's lower, and with my current lifestyle, I should be OK (perhaps even save a bit more). But I just wanted to ask around a bit more, since I don't really have anyone in my life that I can ask about these with.

Here's what's happening on the roads:  
• Another weekend of Revive I-5 expansion joint replacement. From 7:30 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday, southbound I-5 between I-90 and the West Seattle Bridge will be down to one lane. The I-90 ramps to southbound I-5 will be open and the express lanes will be northbound all weekend.  
• The SR 520 bridge will be FULLY CLOSED from 11 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday as we install girders on the Montlake Lid and realign the highway. The bicycle/pedestrian trail across Lake Washington will be open.  
• From 7 a.m. Saturday until Thursday, Sept. 1, SR 164 will be FULLY CLOSED between SE 400th St. and 212th Ave. to finish fish passage work. Detours will be in place - passenger vehicles using SE 400th to 212th Ave, freight using SE 400th to SR 169 - and there will be some local access for residents and businesses.

Expect significant congestion on alternate routes like I-405, I-90 and SR 99. Consider transit if you can, or time your travel for really early or late. Please be patient and stay alert for road workers. We want everyone to have a safe weekend.

Greetings Transit Board and Decision Makers:

I am writing to urge the Sound Transit Board to NOT build a Transit hub in the CID - Chinatown/International District.  My objections are based upon; (list any or all;)

\-  Great loss of CID businesses and jobs 

\-  6 to 10 years of continuous, disruptive construction that will kill CID businesses.

\-  Health and safety issues impacting residents, workers, and visitors

\-  Destruction of historic and cultural buildings

\-  Loss of cultural, historic, economic, artistic activities and practices

\-  Erosion of ethnic/culturally based community/neighborhood

\-  (Your own statement)

I urge you to identify and study the other alternatives.

Most sincerely, (your name)

&amp;#x200B;

And I should add, my boyfriend and I live together and we both have cars. So my temporary solution is to park my car at my Aunt's house because there is no way I'm going to  be able to pay another $275 for another spot with the $2,000 I am paying for my rent already. So for now my boyfriends truck is parked at our apartment, and my little Chevy spark is in Kirkland. 

Then today I was running late to work, so I had to take the Truck (I usually do the 20 min walk to work), so I had to park in a random pay to park parking lot.

Please see results for Pew Research and the initial ideology poll here. 

Pew's methodology and explanation of typology is here: [https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/beyond-red-vs-blue-the-political-typology-2/](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/beyond-red-vs-blue-the-political-typology-2/)

The questions were difficult to answer by design. They come out with a new quiz every few years that matches the current political landscape. 

For our purposes, we can say ""Stressed Sideliners"", ""Ambivalent Right"", and ""Outsider Left"" are all moderates. The majority of users seem to be clustered in that middle third. 

The next largest group would be your more Democrat-aligned folks - ""Democratic Mainstays"", ""Establishment Liberal"", ""Progressive Left"". 

The smallest group is our conservative bunch. 

What can we learn here? 

r/SeattleWA is not conservative, and a two-party system does not accurately describe everyone's complex beliefs.  As many of us discovered, even the Pew Research quiz was not able to describe everyone's beliefs. 

What I really want us to understand is that there is a difference between what politicians say to get votes, and what citizens really think. What a leader says and does is not necessarily reflective of their constituents. 

If someone really wanted to, the next steps would be a sentiment analysis on posts from this sub to clarify whether r/SeattleWA is really conservative or not.",False,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,276274,public,confidence,self,Results from Pew Research Poll,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/wvvns7/results_from_pew_research_poll/,all_ads,6,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'DVIjhs_jN0pnmMNy4Sef_UC8i9cHQ8bY4FK4Z3nvQpE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uqtHv7lKEsw1ffbN9OwgNI0H8ig_UUue6PkCK0Fzl0o.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a20f7aa4b717e15691eaa8609d1b005e6d5c4937', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uqtHv7lKEsw1ffbN9OwgNI0H8ig_UUue6PkCK0Fzl0o.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a167414b79a5b8e286da1e4085c8117799a5d392', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uqtHv7lKEsw1ffbN9OwgNI0H8ig_UUue6PkCK0Fzl0o.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc4d0317e31bf105174db4b1725a313853e70ff2', 'width': 320}, {'height': 334, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uqtHv7lKEsw1ffbN9OwgNI0H8ig_UUue6PkCK0Fzl0o.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=815ac8071ff0864a391eac7882a05b70c0fdd9e1', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uqtHv7lKEsw1ffbN9OwgNI0H8ig_UUue6PkCK0Fzl0o.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed07060dec538da4fab6b1d4ba5f2aed959db89d', 'width': 960}, {'height': 565, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uqtHv7lKEsw1ffbN9OwgNI0H8ig_UUue6PkCK0Fzl0o.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cf0e4e79681a68930eb508ced20e42ae0852781', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 628, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/uqtHv7lKEsw1ffbN9OwgNI0H8ig_UUue6PkCK0Fzl0o.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e3d0d46d1258f70d50e2f1508cdc7cbacfc8628d', 'width': 1200}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,

I’m 25, veteran, no license and get nervous/anxious to drive. 

I’ve driven around parking lots and just felt very out of place I guess you could say. 
I get nervous about whether I’m too close on the right side, too wide of turns, maintaining speed limit while being aware of surroundings outside of car, etc. 

It’s crazy to me because I’ve never been one to get visibly scared or nervous and I’ve never been one to shy away from jumping head on into something very new to me, but with driving I get nervous and almost get a little shaky and just don’t want to do it. 

My VA therapist says since I only started feeling this way after I came home from a deployment that it could be a sign of a kind of unaware form of PTSD from an incident while deployed. It makes sense to me, but at the same time it kind of doesn’t. I think I’m more so just still extremely shocked that I am having serious trouble with this. 

I’ve tried to talk to driving schools about adult training, but they all tell me their schools are for teens and that I would have to book many hourly classes back to back to try and learn that way, only problem is I just can’t afford to pay hundreds (in most cases over a thousand) of dollars to book these classes. 

So my question is does anybody have any advice or ideas of what I can do to get more comfortable with the idea of driving? 
I know, I’ll only learn by doing, but I need more detail than that.

First time posting here.  I'm a new neighbor.  My family and I just moved to King County from New Orleans, LA. 

We are exiles or the horrendous weather tormenting New Orleans.  My partner lost his family home to Katrina when he was a child and we recently experienced two hurricanes back to back (2020 and 2021) and an EF3 tornado that effectively destroyed our home.

We are currently renting but looking to purchase a home with a yard somewhere in King County. 

I was just wondering if anyone had some Realtor recommendations and maybe areas that we're not too familiar with yet that are not as high as Mercer Island or Redmond, Bellevue. We are trying to stay as close to Mercer Island as realistically possible for work purposes.

What do you think the traffic will be like from West Seattle once the bridge reopens?

Conversely if you have any questions about New Orleans or you are planning to move there and want to know the scoop feel free to comment or PM me anytime.

Thank you so much in advance for reading me and for taking the time to respond to my questions!  I'm happy to be here :)

I'll be rolling through Seattle for a few days coming up and am questioning a bit about some safety concerns that I've been reading about. The whole trip is going to be surrounded by a few Mariners games, so my hotel location needs to be ideally in an area where I can get down there easily, but the question becomes where is the safest place? Pioneer Square has some places that are within walking  distance which is a huge plus in my books but I've read too many things  talking about it being sketchy and unsafe, especially at night, and so I'm looking for some recommendations on a better area to stay, and at this point, I would assume them to be true. I'm used to city living and transportation, so I'm not afraid to take the 1 line or anything like such, and would rather avoid renting a car if possible. Obviously, I'm aware that it's always tough to ask locals for a hotel to stay at since they aren't the ones staying at them, and I'm not so much looking for a specific place as much as I am a safer area to stay in. Any other tips or things to be aware of are welcomed as well.

However, I've been having a bit of difficultly on deciding where to go. I've been in Washington for nearly 6 years now, and have since lived in Bellevue, Capital Hill, Kirkland, and South Lake Union. 

In seeing my friends, I've seen most neighborhoods in Seattle, but after making the move to Capital Hill, it thoroughly burned me out, and I've lived on the east side ever since. I think I have a quiet energy, and Capital Hill just wasn't for me. Also, many of the other areas have given me this sort of anxiety when I visit them, as I had not lived in a city prior to moving to Washington. It was a bit of a culture shock when I realized you couldn't just wish *everyone* a nice day, as I used to do on the East Coast. That said, I love my friend's quirks, and the general uniqueness of Seattle-ites, but I think living directly amongst it shuts me down.

However, on the east side, while I do find this since of peace, I've had a few odd experiences here and there. In Bellevue, while I felt like I could get along with everyone I met, there is this odd since of privilege or prestige amongst the people I've met. It's not bad, but I didn't realize how many things I just don't care about until I moved there. At one point, I recall a random person hitting on me at a bar (*I actually just went for lunch*), but the moment they saw my order, they said our astrology signs didn't align. In hindsight, it was funny, but incredibly random. 

I did grow particularly fond of Kirkland though, but the longer I was there, the more I wished something random would happen from time to time. I kind of felt like I had retired or something sometimes. Whenever my Seattle friends visit, it is always a breath of fresh air, but I feel like they have more fun trying to drag me back out to their side of the lake, than to do anything on this side of it. Also, even if I do get them to stay on this side for something, it usually comes in the form of coffee meets, lunches, and dinners, as opposed to going out to a bar. I don't think they enjoy that, but for some reason, I do.

This past weekend, I thought it'd be a good idea to visit every neighborhood in Seattle, as well as some other cities nearby, as even those within the cities on the east side. What I found, was that I'm not really a fan of most places in Seattle, not even the places my friends had lived. You can only learn so much by just driving through though. I did find Green Lake to be somewhat interesting, but after I drove a few blocks out from the lake, I felt the same. I think I could do it if I stayed within that bubble, and only enjoyed the lake front, but that seems like it may be a waste of a move. I'm not sure. 

Is there a place in Seattle that those who grew up on the east side typically enjoy? Or, maybe, is there a place in Seattle that has less of a chaotic city vibe for people who didn't grow up in a space like that? Should I just stop trying and see if I can find something new on the east side instead? I don't mind traveling to a place to check it out.

I wanted to find a place in the eastside but it is too expensiv. I also need to be close to good public transportation. The best I could get is right between Fremont/Wallingford, which I also like because it’s walkable. 

I rarely ever go to Los Angeles. The filth and the drugs and homelessness is too depressing. Even just going to the airport over there puts me in a bad mood. I’m going to be working in downtown Seattle but other than that I don’t really think I’ll want to hang out there from what I’ve seen online.

At the very least, is Fremont/Wallingford safe? Can I go out and about on my own without seeing drug addicts and tents everywhere? I just want a safe clean area for living. Then i can spend days off on the eastside.

First visit since the pandemic. Although this post has no commentary on the pandemic.

Quite honestly, Vancouver is very blah. Seattle is better in almost every way. Of all the Pacific Northwest cities from Eugene, Oregon all the way up to Whistler, Vancouver is easily the most overrated. 

Let me count the ways:

* The gay scene sucks. In Seattle and other US cities, there are parks and beaches where gays congregate to see and be seen. Completely absent in Van.
* The food scene sucks. People gush about the food in Vancouver and I'm like... Where? Every restaurant on Google maps had crap ratings. I went to some ramen place that was highly rated, and it was unremarkable.
* The coffee scene sucks. Want a hipster coffee shop with fresh light roast pour over? Sorry, it literally does not exist in Vancouver.
* I drove back to the US from Vancouver to Abbotsford. I don't know what cities I passed, but I think there were at least two cities right next to each other with skyscrapers that looked exactly the same. Canadians are paying a million dollars for that??
* Everything is more expensive than the US and the quality isn't as good.
* People are less friendly than in Seattle. I didn't think that was possible. 

Just wow. I do not understand why people gush over Vancouver. ""The mountains are right next to the city!"" Yeah ok. I bet 99% of you never go into them.

I’m in a dilemma, here. I received a job offer to work for the state government in downtown Seattle. I was born and raised (and live) 150ish miles east of Seattle. My experience is in the military and in forest firefighting, have a degree in legal studies, and got a job offer to assist homeless folks in Seattle in finding work and housing. The offer from the state government is $51,000 per year / $26/hr (starting). Unfortunately, the gas, parking, all that stuff isn’t covered and am expected to pay $20 a day for private parking. It’s a 9-5 job. 

Could I survive on $51k a year in Seattle? I don’t have any spouse or children. My vehicle is paid off. My only expenses would be gas, food, car insurance, my phone, and housing (which I still haven’t found).

We are a lab in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at UW ([http://faculty.washington.edu/ludomax/lab/](http://faculty.washington.edu/ludomax/lab/)) and we're constantly looking for adults (and children!) for our research studies! We recruit adults who stutter and adults who do not stutter (as well as children who stutter and children who do not stutter!) for a variety of experiments in which **you'll be compensated $15/hr**. We can **reimburse for street parking** and we will provide you with a **free hearing screening** as part of the experiment.

Most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words off a screen, although some also involve wearing an electrode cap (like a swim cap) so we can measure your brain activity. Children's experiments involve a free speech and language evaluation by a clinician as well as a small toy for your child.

I'll definitely do a real visit soonish to scope it out... but I was curious to get some local input as well. Basically I haven't traveled a ton and I have some anxieties about leaving Chicago and its amenities.

My biggest curiosity is whether or not one normally has a car in Seattle? Ive spent my adult life thus far surrounded by trains and so I dont have one. I dont really want to get one if I don't have to, so I was curious what the on-the-ground feeling is. Is it like mostly a car city, or do lots of people not bother with them?

Im also kind of worried by the population of the city. Census puts Seattle under a million... but I was curious how the density felt? Is there like still a good social+urban vibe? Eg Lots of distinct neighborhoods, events, things to do, diverse communities, etc. 

I was curious if anyone here knows about University of Washington and specifically its mathematics and physics departments? I would love to know more about how the university is vibe and culture wise. Im also curious where the grad students can afford to live? Quick searches make the area around the uni look kind of pricey!

Lastly has anyone here lived in Chicago before and could contrast them? Or maybe has any insights I might not be thinking of?

Ha!

He has a pretty good position in his company, and recently took a trip out to Seattle at the request of his CEO to join him in meetings he was having with execs from other companies.

The CEO, loves my husband. They talk frequently. I joked with my husband (but was serious) that his boss was going to try and get him to move out Seattle. Currently my husband's job is fully remote. He jokingly told this to his CEO, which in response he got (your wife is right)

Now, we live in MN. (Family of 4. 2 kids. ) Whenever people have brought up moving outside of MN and mentioned Seattle, I always shut it down because it is so much more expensive. SO. MUCH. MORE. We love comfortably and I if I am to ever move, I will not do it if we won't be living as comfortably. The point of moving for us would be an improvement.

Without big change in income I know we'd definitely be giving up a lot and I am not willing to do that. His CEO is making is sound like he will make it worth our whole if we move. So, that's that I guess, but right now we have a2 story home with 4 bedrooms and a nice yard. I know in the Seattle area, something like that is just... Soooo much money. 

IF, his boss is true to his word, and makes a move from MN to the Seattle area affordable for us without us losing any comforts, we would really like to consider it. But we don't know enough. I've never been to Seattle and this last trip was my husband's first time visiting.

A glad-hander at the Seattle Chamber of Commerce named Arthur Priest decided Seattle needed a day dedicated to befriending strangers. He launched Talk to Your Neighbor Day in April 1920:
 “Seattle people have been accused of being too cold and distant,” reported The Seattle Times. “It is being charged that old time Seattle residents are not inclined to converse with people who share their seats on the street cars. Strangers in the city maintain that their polite inquiry regarding the probability that it will rain tomorrow is usually met with a grunt.”
A headline on the story: “Seattle Expected to Thaw Out.” The Freeze was already a thing.
Funny enough, Talk to Your Neighbor Day appears to have been a flop in Seattle. The city didn’t respond and didn’t want to do it again. Priest left town for, presumably, friendlier pastures.
So, did Seattle warm up after that?
No. Another cold spell appeared in the early stages of WWII. In 1942, a woman who came to Seattle from Idaho with her family for wartime work — a writer named Helen Markley Miller —blasted the locals in newspaper stories about what an unfriendly, unneighborly city we were.
“Seattle as a word may have a musical sound, a lilt of its own to all you elder residents, but to me it is an Indian word meaning ‘phooey,’ ” she wrote. The city lacked affordable housing, the old-timers were “clubby,” and the city run by “smug burghers.”
It sounds like the classic Freeze complaints you still hear here in the 21st century.
Interestingly, complaints seem to spike in periods of high population growth, lack of affordability, times when Seattle has been around long enough to have locals who felt well-rooted. When everybody was new to town, few complained. When the ratio of newcomers blossomed, it was grumpy time.
Said one local about Helen Markley Miller’s criticism: “We were a nice peaceful town once and who has changed it? Youse guys.”

Since many of you are probably from the city, or have lived there before, do you think it is worth it to take a trip over there? And if so, are there any precautions I should keep in mind if I visit? Also, aside from that, are there any touristy spots you can recommend to me?

I am a 22 year old recent graduate who recently accepted a job based out of downtown Bellevue where I'd be making around 80k. I've done a lot of research on past moving threads (some now 7-9 years old) and it seems the general consensus is that if you're a young, single adult who enjoys being social and wants to take part in the nightlife culture, meet new people, and be social among young professionals that Capitol Hill, Ballard, or U-District are your best bets. I am someone who has lived in urban areas most of my life and would like to have access to bars, breweries, parks, and events nearby. I felt that from my research the Eastside did not provide many of these, being more family-oriented and more expensive as a whole. I do enjoy the outdoors a good amount and hope to take advantage of that aspect of the surrounding area as well. My budget for a studio probably caps around $1700+ parking (I think this makes sense with my salary, correct me if I'm wrong). 

I was just looking for some reinforcement as to what Seattlites in 2022 think the best neigborhood may be for a college graduate who will be working in downtown Bellevue so I'm not basing my apartment search off 7 year old Reddit threads. I've heard a lot of complaints about the commute over the lake, however I am from the Los Angeles area and am kind of at peace with most of my drives being in the 45 minute range anyways. I do plan on bringing my own car, but I am also aware of bus routes that lead into downtown Bellevue as well as the light rail opening up in 2023, which perhaps I should factor into choosing a place. I've been leaning towards Capitol Hill, but would love to know thoughts about Issaquiah, Kirkland, or other areas back in Seattle proper I should look into.

We live near the cross streets of 32nd Ave E and E Ward (off Madison). He's an indoor/outdoor cat and didn't come home for breakfast early Saturday morning as usual. He is most likely near home but could have travelled or been transported if he was scared enough. 

LION-O is:
Gender: Male
Age: 10
Weight: 13 lbs
Eyes: Green
Fur: Orange &amp; White
Breed: Domestic Medium/Longhair

One of the best ways you can help us find him is by looking in the small spaces of your garages, out buildings, sheds, and crawl spaces under your house.  Leaving garage and shed doors open for an hour or two so he feels like he can run out. If you have dogs or territorial cats it would be helpful to keep them indoors for that time period when the garage or shed is open.

You can also put a bowl of water in your garage in an inconspicuous spot where he will feel safe getting to it. Putting cat food out for him is less important but would be appreciated if you have some available.

https://i.imgur.com/B04WZqx.jpg

He is skittish around people he doesn't know and likely will run if you approach him. Talk quietly and move slowly - try to take a photo and/or a video, and call us immediately with his location if you think you see him.

Is it possible for him to take off and have unpaid leave (if baby is born early before he's been there for one year), and still have a job to come back to guaranteed? Can he be present for my labor and delivery with out facing repercussions from his job, protected by state policies?

His employer only gave him the option to wait until we have the baby's birth certificate before he can apply for leave and they want him to wait for it to be approved before he can take off... that could be weeks after I've given birth. Even by October, he will have worked well over 1,250 hrs.

Ideally, this would a semi-regular ongoing arrangement. I am sort of open to the idea of offering my services on a one time only arrangement, but I am not sure it would be worth the effort.
 
I am not a professional cleaner, but I am the oddball that enjoys cleaning. So, you’ll need to supply whatever cleaning supplies you want me to use (detergents/soap/rags/sponges). I am not willing to bring my vacuum cleaner with me, please already have one. I am willing to clean any room that you want cleaned. If you want me to wash/dry your laundry, we’ll need to discuss that in greater detail. (I am willing to fold and put it away.)
 
I also require you to be home when I clean. You can be working, watching tv, playing video games or whatever. Preferably, you’ll live alone. If you have roommates – they’ll also need to agree to this arrangement.
 
To be super clear, I am NOT looking for money or gifts in exchange. I am not trying to turn this into a money-making opportunity. I live comfortably and have a great a job in healthcare.
 
So, what is the catch? Why am I offering this? Well, as a gay man, I value the connections I have with straight men. (No, I’m not looking for sex.) It satisfies something in me that isn’t necessarily sexual. Completing a task for another person makes the joy brought on by successfully completing a task even greater. And I would enjoy doing this more for a straight man than anyone else. The ideal arrangement for me is to do this for a cis straight man. I would never want to cross a boundary that would make anyone feel uncomfortable or unsafe. What I am looking for is verbal praise – tell me that I did a good job and you appreciate me coming over to clean. It think it would be neat if this could eventually develop into some sort of friendship over time.
 
Before I clean your home, I would want to meet in person at least once to discuss the arrangement and to get to know each other. This can be at coffee shop, a bar, a walk around the neighborhood, or wherever. My goal is to make sure we both feel comfortable with the arrangement.

(1) A vehicle that both (a) uses at least one method of propulsion that is capable of being reenergized by an external source of electricity and (b) is capable of traveling at least thirty miles using only battery power, is subject to an annual seventy-five dollar transportation electrification fee to be collected by the department, county auditor, or other agent or subagent appointed by the director, in addition to any other fees and taxes required by law. For administrative efficiencies, the transportation electrification fee must be collected at the same time as vehicle registration renewals and may only be collected for vehicles that are renewing an annual vehicle registration.

So for a normal non-plug in Hybrid like a Prius, since it cannot be plugged in, that seems to not fulfill (a) which is being re-energized by an external source of electricity.

Also a normal Prius when set to EV mode can't get 30 miles only by battery power. Maybe 1-2 miles at most. Even the prius prime (plug-in) has max range of 25 miles.

This bill was based on the incorrect interpretation of a scientific study that associated high-potency cannabis use with psychosis. In reality, the study did not make any conclusions saying that high-potency cannabis use caused psychosis, but that people with psychosis seemed to use it at a higher rate than the average person. That was it.

When it comes to giving out your votes or talking to your legislators, maybe consider asking them about this and voicing your opinion on the issue.

I'm looking for personal opinions based off your living experiences, but also feedback on where you think I might do better in based off my post. 

I'm 19F currently in Portland, Im making this post because long term this isn't the place I see myself settling. 

I feel like Seattle would be the better choice people and career wise because just from what I've seen people in Seattle are more ""tame"" and there's more opportunities for medical jobs. I currently work in veterinary but I'm thinking of transferring to traditional medical although I'm not sure which field I want to work in specifically. Most likely in mental health though.

I'm from the east coast but have been in the PNW for two years. One thing I've noticed is that alot of the people in Portland are preformative and passive aggressive, is it the same in Seattle?

To make this post shorter, the things I value when it comes to living:

-walkability

-SEASONED food (hopefully people understand what I mean. No offense but portlands food is mediocre. I need seasoning😭)

-alot of dog parks

-cost of living is expensive in both, but I want to be comfortable without breaking my bank. 

-ability to progress in jobs

-being able to access hiking trails or landmarks with less than a 40 minute drive because I hate driving. 

I also feel like it's important to mention that I'm independent (aka no family or friends so if I go broke I'm fucked) so also government assistance quality would be good to know in case of an emergency. What state has better support? 

One last thing..Which state has better education for the cost when it comes to medical?",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,274849,public,confidence,self,Seattle vs Portland: what are the pros and cons of living?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/wdysrm/seattle_vs_portland_what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m looking to get a medium sized forearm tattoo, and already have a few ideas in mind. 
I’ll list my ideas below so people can get a feel of what exactly I’m looking for! (IE something that needs precise line work, shading, etc). 

Two of them are extremely simple.. and fall more under a “precise line work” or shading category! Ones a reaper, in tribute to my friend who committed suicide a few years back. She absolutely loved them and I’d like to remember her by getting one on my arm. 

Second idea would be of a Fox, Wolf, Lion, or mini Leopard. And I know what you are thinking.. “OP that’s stupid don’t do that”. I have multiple reasonings behind this. I have had a pet fox, a wolf hybrid dog, and I currently own a Bengal (which is descendant from Asian Leopards). All of which I deeply love(d), and would like to someday memorialize. The lion is a long story, but in short it’s a tribute to my grandma. She is a Leo and it would fit perfectly because of her fiery spirit (despite the dementia lol)

My third idea (hate to say this but I know it’ll get me a lot of hate and downvotes), would be getting a Demon Slayer tattoo. Once again you’re probably thinking “OP you stupid f*ck”. Hear me out. I’ve been reading the manga for quite some time, and have seen the entirety of the anime and the Mugen Train movie. **That scene when Rengoku died absolutely BROKE me, because his story, what he fought for, and what he came from stood out to me**  Coming from a family that expected everything of me, but constantly called me a failure, Kyojuro is a hero to me. As idiotic as it sounds. Its just an anime I know. I have a real steel carbon Nichirin of Rengoku’s and everything in dedication. I’d want something black and white for now… but would eventually want to do some colour with it! I eventually plan to make a full sleeve of all my favorite anime characters who have inspired me. 

Yes I’m aware this all sounds idiotic. Yes I’m aware it’ll be on my body forever. What matters is if it **means something to me** or not. All of what I have chosen has meaning to me. Therefore I feel no shame in sharing it. I’m still new to the area, so I figured it’d help for me to ask for some pointers/advice on where to contact :)

I went in with the expectation that Dan would get grilled by people and that he'd give empty political responses to his constituents.

Tonight really changed my perspective about Dan and the way he interacts with people who live in District 6. He spent about 15 minutes blasting through his talking points to prioritize over 90 minutes of time to answer questions folks had for him (more to come about that). Through it all, he came across as someone who genuinely cared about solving problems for his constituents. He openly admitted that homelessness is still an issue and that it's not a problem that's been solved, but things really are better than they were six months ago.   Sure, some of his responses dodged the question, but that's to be expected with any politician.  At the end of it all, I got to see him as a sincere human being and not the image of empty rhetoric that gets portrayed in news outlets and places like Reddit.

Related, here's a few things I learned about my fellow constituents in District Six tonight based on their questions:

* Boomer women are really interested in the trees in the Seattle City Limits. Like, really interested.
* People still clap when someone drops the ""defund the police"" wokeism. Dan pushed back against a characterism of him supporting that. 
* Overall frustration from a couple of people for RVs coming back to Greenlake and graffiti in the area
* Boomer women really like trees.
* Other items like voting reform, finishing the missing link were brought up",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,274577,public,confidence,self,An honest perspective from someone who went to Dan Strauss's in-person town hall meeting tonight,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/wav74n/an_honest_perspective_from_someone_who_went_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We signed a 2-year-lease for a house in a Seattle suburb around April/May 2022, based on video conferences with the property manager.  The lease started May 15th. Due to a couple of unexpected issues, we didn’t move to the area until late June (been paying rent since 5/15). When we did the walk through, the house was dirty and carpet was filthy, although we were advised the home and carpet had been professional cleaned and shampooed. 

They were able to send a crew in to rectify the issue within a couple of days. Luckily, my employer was paying for temporary living so nothing additional was out of our pocket. 

We moved in at the end of June.  One of us is 100% remote and the other one is hybrid. 
- Well, then the fun begins. Firstly, the water heater went out. They were able to send someone in within a couple of days and replaced the water heater. 
- Secondly, we received an email from the property manager stated the septic permit was approved and asked if someone will be home to allow access for septic work (we were told it was replaced during the video conference due to 2 patches of dry grass in the backyard).  Apparently, it wasn’t done and they’ll have to dig up the yard to replace the septic ~ ETA 3 weeks with no access to backyard for our child and dog. It was supposed to start this week but no one showed. 
- Thirdly, the AC went out since last Friday. The inside of the home has been around 88 and it’s about 95 on the second floor. There are many tall tress around the property so there is absolutely no breeze, even with all windows opened. We bought a couple of fans to cool down but it doesn’t get below 85 at night.  Our bedrooms are on the second floor. 

We could barely sleep for a week now, been waking up with headaches from heat exhaustion and it’s affecting our performance at work. Our rent is ~$5k/month. 

Management company stated they’re trying to get bids for a new AC system. Owners knew there were AC issues in the past. But ETA is 2 months out. Knowing summer is not over and we’re just dreading working in a sweatshop.  On top of that, we will not be able to enjoy what is left of a gorgeous PNW summer (between these heatwaves) with a dug up yard!

Had we known all these issues, we wouldn’t have rented this house. Any ideas/suggestions re: our options? Would really not having to move…

On the Friday night I got separated from my friends, with no phone, water or jacket lol, and ended up wandering around like a lost soul for hours trying to find them. At the portaloos, I randomly got talking to a girl called Lakshmi *(possibly spelled incorrectly),* who was extremely friendly and suggested that I head back with her and hang out with her and her bf, Kevin. I ended up hanging with them for quite a while and had a great laugh with them. Meeting them picked me out of the rut I was in and was the highlight of my Friday at Shambs.

Both live in Washington but I'm pretty sure Lakshmi said her background is from Cambodia and that Kevin is half Irish and....... I'm not sure what else so I'm going to go with half legend lol...

If anyone in Washington reckons they know who these folks might be I'd greatly appreciate if you could provide some means of making contact *(preferably email or Insta)* so that I could reach out and thank them. In my intoxicated state I completely forgot to ask for their contact details.

Their ""German fare with a Seattle flair"" featured some delicious menu items, especially a potato cake with mushroom sauce they discontinued before I was tired of them. For each stein of beer, you got a stamp. I'd go there to read books about the CIA and filled up one stamp card for a t-shirt, was working on a second one for the patch, but then I had to move to Bainbridge Island to take care of my adoptive parents. I went to a K-Town, Germany high school reunion there for an older class, and had lunch with Seattle's Bloody Mary mix guru Demitri there after visiting their warehouse. It was kind of him to take the time to meet before his kid's soccer game. During Covid Feierabend closed up shop. 

[I really wanted that patch](https://preview.redd.it/ldpttc3vt0e91.jpg?width=1102&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4898af96407c12e1e5d8b4366dad7831ba979a98)

On Capitol Hill I liked Kimchi Bistro, specifically the dish with the egg on top and all of the kimchi fixings on the side. I asked: Americanized. Any chance to practice my chopsticks skills and try foreign beer.

I rode the bus on a super rainy Dick's birthday to Capitol Hill to get a 2-for-1 deal in order to represent and ran across a man waiting for the same bus wearing the same jacket, but like a guy I was clueless to that until it finally struck me on the bus that they were the same, but by then it was too late to mention it.

The Turf some memories, though not a drug haunt for me. They made a mean Denver omelet with cheese, much better than the IHOP I'd sometimes hit up first bus in the morning shift change across from Seattle U that I enjoyed the vibe of during free pancake day. I also found myself poking my nose into a bust across the street from The Turf mid-meal after someone poked their head in the door saying the police just arrested a man with a tripod. There was a pile of Pokémon card packs and syringes laying there as evidence. The Turf moved kitty-corner and rebranded at Ludis, but they still made the best Denver omelets with cheese.

At one point I went on an informal fish &amp; chip quest, and after sampling several places around Seattle, Ivar's next to the ferry held up the best, form-fit the best, tasted the best (? since they all pretty much taste the same), and I didn't have to tip. I like that: it reminds me of Europe. Right after I started boycotting salmon, someone representing the Alaskan salmon industry sat down to me at Ivar's. My concern with Washington salmon is with all the hoops, bells, and whistles the young fish have to go through being trucked in some cases. My cat loves salmon dry food, and I love smoked salmon, just not the state of local fisheries. I've since stopped speaking of boycotting salmon outside of this context.

When I wanted a gyro, the Mediterranean Mix hole in the wall in Pioneer Square was an award-winner according to their banner. I'm wondering if I ever tried their Greek baklava.

Mama's Mexican Restaurant in Belltown's Screamers were delicious enchiladas, and just the right size for my appetite. I was totally getting hooked on them with a strawberry margarita or Mexican dark beer before they shuttered without family to keep it operational. The establishment rebranded as Mama's something-or-another opening at 4pm (after my needs) with a different menu, and no gaudy Elvis statue.

What was that one place that sold a $20 cheeseburger all locally sourced organic? I got one to represent. Tried to find it again a couple of years later, but apparently they'd shuttered.

Under the Rainier Tower was some sports bar that served up a delicious stuffed pepper, but then they discontinued that treat. Buddies from Bainbridge Island got me to do bad things at the music store in-and-out of the building when we were kids.

Was it Meskel Ethiopian Restaurant that was so delicious and highly recommended? It sounds right. The last time there was after helping your typical male brute move furniture and him refusing to wash his hands before sharing food that is shared on the table.

I work at a Joey kitchen in the university village, and we are actively hiring for all front of house and back of house positions! Restaurant experience is required for some but not all positions. 

Here are the positions listed below. 

Serving Liaison -  which with tips is paid about 25-30$ per hour with tips and after working for a month will receive a 250$ signing bonus. This position is basically a busser for sections in the restaurant, along with other various tasks such as filling waters, restocking silverware etc and does not require previous restaurant experience, but it does require some energy! 

Server - This position typically requires previous serving experience. After working for a short time and getting a full section and solid shifts you easily make 40-50$ an hour with tips. This position will receive a 500$ signing bonus after a month of being hired. 

Guest service - this position is basically the host of the restaurant, they are paid 25$/ hour plus. Basically dealing with guests at the front, using our system to assign tables and guests and providing guests with a greeting at the door. 500$ singing bonus after a month of working. 

Bartending - this position requires previous bar tending experience and is pretty self explanatory. Bartenders with solid shifts make between 35-50$ an hour with tips. 500$ signing bonus. 

Back of house positions - include dishwashing, line cook, and expo. Expo is basically a food organizer at the window. Line cook is pretty self explanatory and none of these technically require restaurant experience but it definitely helps quite a bit. 500$ bonus for all these positions. All these back of house positions roughly pay 20-25$ an hour. Full time positions in the back of house are readily available. 

This restaurant has tons of opportunities to grow and move up into higher paying positions, and has a great atmosphere and great co-workers, which is my personal favorite aspect of the job.

Our cities put effort into spending millions of dollars on other things but not opening care facilities to house the mentally ill and get them help.

I’m sorry many will disagree but what other help can we give these folk? We need to put them into forced mental care, they are too dangerous and we have been saying this for years. We need to bring back institutions, we need to open psychiatric jobs for youth and adults who need it and cannot wait on a waiting list and spend $90 a session.

Unfortunately, it, along with some other big events, coincide with a very busy weekend of roadwork that was scheduled months in advance, including another weekend of Revive I-5, a full closure of SR 18 and some other areas of work on I-5 in Seattle.

You've heard us say it before, and it's still true: It's impossible to get all this work done and completely avoid disrupting events in the summer in Seattle. Much of this work can only be done when the weather is warm and dry, which is a small window for us. Postponing isn't an option, as it would cost a significant amount of money and put us behind both for this summer work season and next year's. So we do the best we can to let people know ahead of time so they can plan. This includes using public transportation, arranging carpools and adjusting your schedules to leave earlier. As someone headed to the stadium this weekend, I get it, but I also know we need to get this work done.

Prostitution has exploded in Seattle, showing that there is a demand for sex. Where this demand came from is somewhat puzzling. I posit two explanations:

Aggravated women in relationships, when the men are the same schmucks as anywhere else. Men around here can also have money to spend. 

Seattle's lax attitude towards sex.  Or it could be a combination of the two. 

The morality of prostitution is hotly debated, and there are a few areas of thought:

Prostitution is sex slavery, and the women are trafficked. The men who buy sex are looking for power. 

Exchanging sex for money reduces the woman to an object, and it is a sign of a society's decay. 

Prostitutes willingly go into the line of work, and legalization would provide another source of tax revenue to the city. This would be analogous to marijuana, but would probably increase demand while removing the need for pimps. 

What I would like to ask all of you is:

Did prostitution bring more crime to the city? Is it a problem worth addressing? Is the current policy of prosecuting johns effective? Are there alternative methods to attack the motivation for prostitution on the supply and demand side?

First off, please let me know if this is not the right sub to post this here.  The first week of August, I will be visiting your lovely Seattle area for 7 nights/78 days with the focus being Mt. Raineer.  For the first 4 nights, I will be in the park exploring all that it has to offer. 

The remaining time, the following are other areas I have never explored and wanted some feedback of where you'd take a visiting friend who enjoys the outdoors, urban life, and cultural/history landmarks.  

\- Olympia NP

\- Puget Sound area (specifically seeing the islands west of Seattle like Port Orchard, Belfair, etc.  


\- Northern area of Seattle like Everett, Marysville, etc.  

I have only been to Seattle once and that was about a decade ago seeing all the touristy items (Pike Place, Space Needle, dwnton Seattle mainly).  I will have a car and accommodations have not been set.  I am from San Francisco, so anything quirky/unusual from a local's perspective would be most helpful.

Tl;dr After a two-week road trip, after getting dropped off I noticed an hour after that I had lost my phone, but I knew it was in the car. However, it hasn't been found in any of my friends' luggage and I have emptied mine many times. One possibility is that it got lost somewhere at a Brown Bear Car Wash (12506 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98125). They brought the car there to clean it out the same day. I tried searching the vehicle after it was cleaned and found nothing sadly. The phone was last seen on July the 7th, the day the car was cleaned.

I tried using find my iPhone but didn't get any useful results, I don't remember if the phone had data turned on or not so maybe that's why.

The phone's color is either silver or grey. And this is the link to the phone case I was using [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0981P48T6/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0981P48T6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

Please dm me if you have any ideas, I have been told it's probably in the middle of a landfill somewhere by now but I don't want to lose hope since there are some pictures and videos from the trip I would really like to be able to access.

I also called the car wash place a few days after I lost my phone but the regional manager hasn't gotten back to me, maybe my voicemail wasn't the best?

Last week, however, it got worse. I can't flush the toilet or turn on the shower, and only a drip comes out of the faucet. I can safely assume the washer and dishwasher would also be useless.

I filed an emergency maintenance request for these issues. The property management company acknowledged the issue, which is building wide, and they think it's related to construction across the street. They are getting a million inspectors and opinions before doing anything to fix it. A maintenance guy who works for the property company said they just need a water pump and the landlord's approval to install it...

Over the weekend, they didn't provide me with any accommodations so I messaged the property managers. They told me there's a vacant unit where I can shower and said ""not sure what to tell you"" about the toilet not flushing. One got really annoyed with me when I asked about a shower curtain in the vacant unit. He said there's not one and no, he will not be going over on his day off to put up a shower curtain. In this case I just used the vacant unit's shower without a liner or curtain.

It's been 5 days without enough water to use my bathroom. The sink drips enough that I can leave it on for a while to fill a Brita pitcher for drinking and cooking (and filling the toilet tank). I can't believe there's no urgency to fix this. 

Do I have any rights as a tenant? Everything I've read online says they have 72 hours to start fixing the issue or I can hire someone to do it, expensing the costs from my rent... but realistically I can't hire someone to fix a whole building's plumbing.

We have:

Henry Clay Dennison - An economically backwards socialist who is interested in Ukraine and Cuba.

Mohammed Hassan Said - A disgraced MD/PhD who is airing dirty laundry with Patty Murray.

John Guenther - The tribal member who is interested in fighting a culture war, disallowing senators to own stocks, and wants to somehow bring back nuclear power. 

Tiffany Smiley -  The nurse who has worked with the VA whose experience may or may not be translatable to the Senate.

Dan Phan Doan - A young tech worker, but undeveloped platform.

Dr. Pano Churchill - Has an experience leading the environmental parliament and Independent Lincoln Party, but also has an undeveloped platform. 

Dave Saulibio - A former CEO of DAS Electronics and manager at Boeing who is bringing back politics from the 1960s by painting himself as a left leaning Republican. 

Sam Cusmir - Your actual working class pick who runs his own business and farm. 

Bill Hirt - Not really interested in running for Senate, but wants to bring attention to his blog and air dirty laundry with the light rail. 

Jon Butler - All over the place but is mostly focused on family court reform. 

Bryan Solstin - An economically backwards Bitcoin bull who thinks that cryptocurrency can back up the dollar. This is at least novel from the gold standard. 

Martin D. Hash - Highly educated, but wants you read his book to understand his platform instead of putting it on his website. Not sure if he is running because he cares or if he is trying to add another accolade to his resume. 

Patty Murray - Your corporate Democrat who claims that she is fighting for union jobs and abortion. It may be time to evaluate whether she has accomplished anything at all in her 30 years in Congress. She is using the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as a selling the point, but the Build Back Better plan and easy money policies are part of the reason why we have inflation in the first place. 

Thor Amundson - Your other working class who is concerned about Hanford, nationwide internet access, overturning Citizen's United, and is interested in geothermal energy. Didn't Hillary say she was going to try to overturn Citizen's United? How did that go?

Charlie Jackson - The Coast Guard engineer who is concerned about the national debt. 

Naz Paul - The entrepreneur from Bellevue who believes in civil discussion, but is unclear in her policies. 

Ravin Pierre - The aerospace engineer who wants politicians to wear bodycams in lobby meetings, expand social services, and reduce military spending. 

Leon Lawson - Mostly unclear. Wants transparency, marijuana decriminalization, and criminalization of big pharma. 

This list and their statements were tough to get through, but it is still great that we have a lot of options. 

A practical choice would be able to navigate D.C. politics, and be able to pass bills. Sadly, people unaffiliated with the Democratic or Republican party don't accomplish as much. Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders are famous, but nobody votes with them. 

Personally, I would be ok experimenting with someone who hasn't had experience in the Senate.

She tried to find the lost and found, but had two teenagers in tow that needed to catch two separate flights. So I guess her solution was to take it????

Anyways, we have and I am taking responsibility to reconnect it with its owner. There is an Apple brand item in there, which I plan on going to an Apple store with to try and find your name. There is also another high value item with the suitcase.

Please PM me and tell me the items inside and suitcase description so we can get this settled. If you see this and still had to catch your flight, then get a family member or friend to meet me so I can give this back to you.

I am sorry for my mother's ridiculousness. I hope this gets home to you!",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,273632,public,confidence,self,Found suitcase in SeaTac Elevator,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/w0shou/found_suitcase_in_seatac_elevator/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Down to their core they truly seem to hate women, their spouses, daughters, you name it. 
My question is, why? 
Are women so overly transplanted from the mid-west? And have forgotten to stand up to this behavior through the glum of Seattle rain? 
Or is it something else? 
In people watching strangers and talking with 100s of randoms going from a nice conversation to anything slightly deep, like example: 
“When was the last time you treated your girlfriend to spa day?”
It would get aggressively met with feminist insults; 
“I know how to take care of my woman! And if she wants something she has to ask me for it. You fung feminist!” 

I’m asking for a REAL social experiment here-  
For those who live in Seattle/ Suburbs, people watch for a day. Listen to conversations around you. Ask questions of strangers. 
I am legit curious - are all Washington men secret women haters? 

Is this just the beginning to why women have it so hard in work place? Don’t get paid the same, get harassing questions, roe v wade BS…?

I am a college student interested in politics and civil service working on a project to increase the accessibility of the City Council. I often hear how important local government is, but it is nearly impossible to figure out what they are doing. So, a few other students and I started writing short nonpartisan summaries of their meetings that can be automatically sent to your email each week. Here is a sample newsletter, but the real thing has hyperlinks (I just can't include them here). If anyone would like to see a more interactive version of the newsletter before committing to sign up, please PM me your email and I will send you a copy! This project is new, and in order for it to be the most effective, we need all the feedback we can get! Any suggestions are much appreciated.

I'm trying to see if I have the legal right to ask them to compensate my loss.

I am a college student from California and came to Seattle to live over the summer. I found someone over the internet to sublease their room to me. We signed a contract drafted by them in another language other than English, basically stating that we agreed that they are renting their bedroom to me and the contract only mentions I should compensate them if I break the lease but no rules saying that they should pay me back if they break it. Now after living for a month I found out that this apartment building does not allow subleasing at all, and in order to properly sublease the room, the current tenant has to pay 1000 dollar to the property management in order to for me to keep staying. The current tenant is moving back and demands me to move out **within 4 days.** At this point, they're straight up stepping on me and walking over me. I definitely want to let them pay for their action, but so far they've been really tough about this and don't want to compromise. 

What are the legal actions I could take in order to ask this current tenant to compensate my loss and is it legally right to do so? Would appreciate any suggestions!

I see it all the fucking time. Whether it is Seattle's propensity to just put shit on the corner with a note that says ""Free"" (aka littering) or just the act of walking around with a bottle, setting it down, and walking away, what the fuck?

I know we have a problem with tweakers compulsively rooting through garbage cans, but this isn't that.

My first night in Seattle I was in Cap Hill behind an audi waiting for a stoplight, I watched a hand holding a mcdonalds bag extend from the passenger window, rotate to dump the contents on the ground, and then the hand just let go of the bag. My mind was blown. 

Maybe I'm insane for carry a wrapper around in my pocket for hours until I find a trash can. Maybe I'm fucked up for putting my wrappers BACK into the bag and rolling up the bag for later. Maybe I'm insane for going to a park and putting all the debris from a meal or picnic into the sacks I brought them in.

Maybe  it's the one week I was in the scouts before getting kicked out, or the 90s recycling greenwashing in my brain, but I kind of thought we had all agreed - as a society - that you are a fucking piece of shit dirtbag if you just shovel wrappers and plastic out of your car onto the ground, or huck a can into a bush? 

Has there ever been a reasonable argument against ""hey, don't throw that on the ground, it's shitty""?

The cop said I was swerving and asked if I would consent to a breathalyzer. I said no, so he said then we have to go to the hospital and do a blood draw. Okay whatever... I asked if my friend who lived like 10 minutes away could come get my car and he said no it has to be impounded. Fine, inconvenient but not the end of the world.

Then I remembered I'm driving my dad's car because mine is in the shop and he's the registered owner. We went to the hospital did the draw and he said he was releasing me and I wasn't being charged with anything. Okay cool. I went and got the car about 12 hours after it being towed.

But now I'm wondering, my dad is the registered car owner; is he gonna be sent a notice on why it was towed in the first place?

I was just curious about the Hiring process in Washington state. I have applied for 4/5 grade jobs mainly in central Washington, so in areas like a Olympia School District, Thurston County, Clover Park, Tacoma, and even a couple positions in Sumner Bonney Lake. I probably have at least 30 applications in for current open positions that started to open at the beginning of June. I’ve checked the website daily and applied to more and more positions as they open up. I have a valid Washington state teaching certificate that I just got as well as an active Texas teaching certificate. I have taught for two years in a low income title I school, I have three years of military experience, my undergraduate is in elementary education and my two graduate degrees are in public administration and international relations respectively. 

I’ve talked to a couple HR people within the district and they say that they haven’t gotten any referrals yet for those positions that I applied for. But I haven’t gotten a callback on a single interview. I find it odd with my experience and my education level that I wouldn’t even get a call back to schedule an interview. So I guess my question is, am I missing something? Are the schools waiting on the new bargaining agreement to come to terms before they hire for the new school year? Because some of these positions have been open for over a month .

I've always had strange abilities, as has my mom. We are Jewish and I was always told this gift was passed down through the matrilineal line. 

My abilities are not limitless. I can't move objects or make hypothetical situations happen (I think, see 5). But I do see images or have a secondary, sexless, strong voice give me answers. They do not always do this, in many ways I'm still a clueless homo sapien. 

Here are some examples:

1. As a kid my dad would ask me what state was on the back of a coin for fun. He's spiritual and knows I've got this thing. Most of the time I would give the correct answer (Hawaii, Kentucky, no state, etc.) One of the times I couldn't guess the coin was worn from age. 

2. A very, very smart friend gave me a riddle to solve when we were kids. The voice gave me the answer (can't remember the riddle now, it had to do with a cliff and a lion). She still thinks I'm an absolute genius because of how quickly I spat out the answer. 

3. I constantly dream about things before they happen. I dreamed once about something as mundane as giving a classmate in a red shirt a pencil. Well, about a week later this classmate approaches me with a red shirt. I handed them the pencil before they could ask. My classmates found it wild. We were not close, they had never borrowed anything from me before, their desk was far from mine. 

4. Math problems. Never got credit because I could never show my work. I cannot tell you how thoroughly I suck at math now. 

5. A boy in high school was shitty-shitty to a friend. We were talking about him before graduation and my friend said that one day karma would catch up to him. It certainly wasn't at the time, he had just gotten into an Ivy League. A thought popped up in my head: ""Can karma hurry the fuck up?"" Then I clearly saw him losing his spot and I felt absolutely certain it would happen. Later in August he lost his position for an asshole Facebook post. Kid was a smooth, manipulative operator. It boggles my mind that he made a mistake like that. 

*TW*

6. Ghosts telling me gossip, seeing the former resident of my bedroom in one corner near the ceiling (turns out he had hanged himself in that spot. Ya, I know how wild that sounds.), seeing things that others can't see, once getting possessed by a ghost from the Seven Years War (that story could be a book), just generally being in tune with my environment in a way I can't explain. It's like a hidden part of my brain has a bird's eye view of my environment and I only get glimpses. 

*END TW*

7. Finding things. I was in a city that had a festival where they hid ornaments  in public spaces. I found five immediately (none of my other friends found any in two hours). Put four back and kept the first.

There's definitely more but I'll stop here. The other ones are personal safety situations and that's a wee too personal for now.

How does this affect my personality? I would say I'm creative, spacey, have difficulty concentrating until I have razer focus. When I was a kid I revelled in being different and hammed it up. Nowadays I use my gift to charm. I've noticed I get a lot of attention, especially from men. That's probably just womanhood though. Oh! I look ten years younger than my age. That must be it! 😬

I've been told my unexplainable powers are ADHD. Partially, sure. I don't think that explains most of these examples.

One friend said it wasn't magic but ""hidden, untapped intelligence."" Umm....isn't that magic?

Some other traits: narcissistic tendencies, insecure, two-faced but moral, a false conviction that I am responsible for the fate of the world, lazy.

What's Next?

I was looking through /r/news for the reactions and it was mostly surprisingly positive. 

One of the comments that raised my eyebrow was:

&gt;Practically three things just happened.

&gt;Three things:

	1.	Basically all your magazine bans, your assault weapon bans, your registries, are going to get reheard under the new directive and most likely struck down because they cannot survive without means-end scrutiny.

	•	They are not explicitly struck down by this, but they are going to be extremely hard pressed to withstand the new standard.

	1.	All “May Issue” permitting is done, it now must be “Shall issue”.
	2.	States cannot declare large swathes of areas to be “sensitive areas” and prohibit carrying. They have to shot a historical and traditional pattern of restriction, at the national level.

	•	So saying no guns in the legislature, courthouse, polling places, banks is fine. But explicitly called out what that NY cannot declare Manhattan Island a “Sensitive area”.

&amp;#x200B;

Details: 

\-We take almost all insurance carriers including Apple Health.  

\-If you don't have insurance our prices are typically half the price of private practice.  

\-We offer preventive services (sealants, fluoride), regular and deep cleanings, and restorative services (crowns, implants, fillings) 

\-Because this is a learning environment, getting through the new patient assessments and cleaning will take a few appointments.  

\-Currently scheduling patients on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, either at 8am or 1pm

* the homeless crisis

* Climate Change

Yesterday, he did a four hour podcast on an L.A. Radio Station:

https://player.fm/series/john-and-ken-on-demand-1451538

Before anyone screams *""this podcast isn't about Seattle!!!""* please consider that the *podcast* isn't, but the subject matter *is.*

I purchased Shellenberger's book, and though I find it to be full of great ideas, it's a tough slog. Shellenberger seems to work best in an informal setting where he can interact with people who are passionate about addressing the issues of homelessness and climate change. I think that there's more good info in his interview on Joe Rogan than in his book, or at least it's easier to digest.

I haven't heard this podcast yet, but I was delighted to see that an L.A. radio station had given Shellenberger four hours to discuss this stuff.

I don't live in Los Angeles and I'll admit this isn't a Seattle show, but I've been listening to these guys for 30+ years. They're a bit cornball but I generally prefer them to any radio hosts working in other markets. They do a pretty good job of ranting about the stuff that affects us, while also throwing in enough humor to keep things moving. They're basically like [the Odd Couple](https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/odd-couple-movie1.jpg) but in radio format.

For everyone that has been upset at the amount of rain we have been getting (valid), your summer starts now. Something to remember though is that you moved to Washington state where it rains an insurmountable amount, and occasionally it will rain every single day for a few months on end...That is something you will have to get used to if you want to continue living in the PNW.   
Adapt to the weather through clothing, get a UVB light, stay active through exercise, ensure that you are socializing (even if it is a buddy-check), stay away from ""sleep revenge"", and take vitamin D supplements if SAD is affecting you too immensely. I honestly love the rain, but understand other's frustrations. Just understand how good we have it here versus other places.  


as a bonus, here is some excellent places to visit while it is nice out:  
 \- Titlow beach 

\- steamboat rock trailhead 

\- starry hill observatory 

\- rattlesnake ledge trailhead 

\- Tolmie peak trailhead 

\- Wenatchee state park 

\- literally ANYWHERE along cascade loop (HW 20) 

\- artist point 

\- Sunrise (CLOSED FOR THE SEASON); anywhere along highway 410

\- Stevens Canyon rd, go up to Paradise  

\- Yakima River Canyon

This place feels anti-human sometimes, like your supposed to shut down all of the little quirks and ticks that make you a person. And of course this is a horrible set of circumstances for getting laid or making friends. 

But I finally had enough and after 18 months of no action I forced myself to go to bars and clubs for the weekend and after getting turned away about 50 times, I finally took a lady home and smoked her boots bigly.

Additionally, I had a few thoughts cross my mind while watching the parade:

1 - How are all these parents OK with their children seeing the naked bike ride and the general high volume of naked people? I'm not puritanical by any stretch, but taking an 8 year old to that seems like it would have a bad affect on them.

2 - There were lots of people filming the naked bike ride and taking pictures. Isn't that fucked up? I get people are putting themselves out there in a public space, but that seems perverse to take pictures of them.

3 - All of the furries going up and high fiving and hugging children. Isn't the whole furry thing predominantly sexual? Isn't that fucked up given the kids just think they are people in animal costumes, unaware that is their kink?

Overall, there were a lot of sexual overtones to what was going on. If it were just adults there I wouldn't give a shit. But the large amount of kids present honestly made me feel uncomfortable.

2. A Xbox Series X($650): with one extra controller, a GameStop gift card, and 3 months XGPU membership.
3. A Nintendo switch OLED($350).
4. $1000 cash.

Hi! We made this movie in WA state and it's screening at the SIFF Cinema Egyptian this Thursday, June 16 at 6:30pm with a Q&amp;A after! We premiered virtually at SIFF 2021 and this is our first time screening in theaters in Seattle. 

""All Sorts"" is a quirky office comedy about an underground folder filing competition - a fight club for nerds!

1. Can whales be seen from Alki beach decently without a boat tour?

3. You highly recommended for visitors? I’d like to experience the city more then just super touristy spots.

As I'm getting close I see a woman screaming at an intersection saying she can't see.

My first instinct was to ignore it assuming she was probably on something. I then heard her say ""Please someone call me an ambulance"". At that point I couldn't ignore her. She wasn't being coherent at all as I called 911 and dispatch was also able to hear her screaming while I was on the phone.

As a few officers arrive they get more details out of her. Turns out she was maced with bear spray twice, directly in her eyes for refusing to give some piece of shit of a man a blowjob.

I'm glad I stopped, she said she had been screaming for help for 20 minutes and everyone was ignoring her. I mean I almost drove off too. I lost a lot of time with my fares and missed some good chances to make money that night. But this is definitely an interaction I won't forget.

Ladies, I really wish yall didn't have to deal with this crap from males all the time. I want to help but idk how.

The stores have an edge of assuming everyone is a thief with more beeping cameras in the cosmetics aisle, more locked goods throughout, those silly little swinging gates at the entrance (these are becoming more common elsewhere), and enclosed liquor areas where you have to purchase there instead of up front. I know these decisions were made at a higher level, but it seems to have made employees snarkier.


The delis seem to never be able to cut meat with their machines being cleaned or otherwise down throughout the day (to be clear: I just don't believe them).


I've never had a store refuse to sell me alcohol after working on refrigeration for kegs and having a smight odor of stale beer. I've had an employee argue with me after they handed me the wrong pack of smokes.

People at checkout look and act miserable. God forbid you need to go to the customer service desk for something like smokes, a money order, or any sort of return since they are especially salty. 


I don't know if this is because they are treated poorly by management, or if it is the opposite and supervisors just don't give a shit how enployees act.

I'm an international student who's been in US for like 10 months.

There's drug needles in children parks, home invasions, thieves robbing small businesses, breaking into cars, assaulting people, and so much more.

I've seen all of the above with my own eyes these past 10 months.

From my perspective, the response of the authorities to these criminals is absolutely fucking garbage. 

I saw cops bust a homeless camp in a fucking children's park who were doing heroin or something and then the next day it just continues and people act like nothing ever happened and don't even raise their concerns about this.

I also learnt that in Seattle, you can steal up to 500 dollars or something and not get caught. What in the fucking world is going on? This literally encourages people to steal.

My student friends got spat at on the ave, I saw a homeless dude fully naked masturbating in the middle of the street. And literally no one in my uni seems to be concerned about the alarming crimes that's happening in our area. 

And apparently, you can't even defend your home or your family if someone breaks into your house if the criminal doesn't attack you. This is so stupid. Yeah sure I'll watch someone breaking into my house in front of me, my kids and break my windows and steal my stuff and not do anything. I'll instead wait like a good little boy for the criminal to attack me.

Instead of talking about these issues, students keep fighting for stuff, that in my opinion, is far less harmful than all the stuff I talked about. If you don't use someones correct pronouns, you'll get cancelled by a huge mob and you can get expelled. Meanwhile there's fucking junkies cooking meth and doing drugs in a children's park and apparently the other issue is more important. I am all for LGBT and pronouns and all that btw.

There are rallies to ""abolish"" police, etc. These students say that we can ""handle things ourselves and don't need University PD"". Yeah go live in your fucking utopia you fucking numbskulls. Instead of focussing on issues that directly affect honest and hard working people, other stuff is more important.

A lot of my neighbors are selling, and I think they're trying to ""time"" the top of the market.

In a ""normal"" market, an influx of new inventory would cause prices to stabilize or fall. I personally think that housing inventory is the number one metric that you can use to predict where prices are going. Basically, when inventory is very low, prices will inevitably rise. Here's what inventory looks like right now - note that the dearth of inventory in 2020 and 2021 contributed to a rise in prices:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR

So with the sudden uptick in inventory, we would expect prices to stabilize or fall. Basic supply and demand.

**But here's where I'm noticing something weird:**

As noted above, many of my neighbors are attempting to ""cash out at the top of the market,"" and because of this, they're listing their homes at prices that are quite obnoxious. I live in a housing development with more than a hundred houses, and there are basically three types of homes in the complex. Because the homes are so similar, it's quite easy to determine what a fair market value is.

And in the last 3-6 months, I'm seeing homes listed at 30-50% over the Zillow and Redfin estimates.

So this is a situation that I don't think I've seen:

* Inventory is going up, which would normally cause prices to go down

* But prices are *exploding,* because the people who are moving aren't really motivated to sell because they NEED to sell; they're selling because they're trying to time the top of the  market. Basically doing a cash grab.

Six months ago, if you'd asked me what would happen with home prices in 2022 and 2023, my expectation was that prices would continue to go up - *just not as fast.* But instead, something different his happening, which is that the prices seem to be doing a mad dash to a higher peak than ever.

Again - **I don't have a crystal ball** - if prices were ""only"" going up 0.5-1.5% per month this year, I would feel better about where they're at now. But that's not what's happening - *price increases are actually accellerating.* 

https://www.zillow.com/seattle-wa/home-values/

This paragraph is purely speculative, but here goes: What seems to be happening, is that a lot of homeowners are expecting another housing crash and they're trying to ""time the top."" This is leading to a jump in inventory. (The jump in inventory is unmistakable, check out the graph above.) 2022 is much different than 2008. In 2008, there were thousands of people who were living in homes where they had nearly no equity. In 2022, the people who are selling have hundreds of thousands in equity, sometimes even millions. One of the houses in my neighborhood is listed for almost $2M more than it's original prices. *It's three years old.* Because these sellers are winding up with so much money when they sell, I think it will tend to inflate home prices and rent, as these former owners cash out a million in equity and move in to luxury rentals, downsize into smaller homes, or purchase homes outright. This is very different than 2008; in 2008-2012 the banks were selling homes at a fraction of their original price, because they were getting these underwater assets off their balance sheet. The people who are selling in 2022 are nearly never underwater; it's so much more difficult to get a loan in the last ten years, when compared to 2001-2008.

Normally I would evaluate prices on a year over year basis, but prices are getting so weird, I think it's worthwhile to look at them on a month over month basis. In particular, notice that prices have gone up more in the last three months than at any time in the last decade, despite the fact that the cost of borrowing has increased by 50% in the last six months! This is unprecedented.

Both recent times she fainted, she just fell rapidly backwards to the floor and could not figure out what happened for several minutes (although her eyes remained half open). The second time a few days ago, she suffered a scalp laceration with profuse bleeding. Had to be taken to hospital in an ambulance and get staples. CT scan and heart ECG came back ok.

She has a blood pressure of around 80 (top number) in the mornings, but we only let her work in the kitchen after it rises to 100. Perhaps it still declines back to 80 while she is working, but usually her blood pressure is only low in the early mornings after waking up.

I have a friend whose parents bought a place in my college town, and a total of 5 of us planned to live in his house as tenants.

Now, the problem is that he (19 yo) will be our landlord, and I've endured lots of red flags (like him joking ""I'm the landlord so I can kick you out right"", pricing the rent higher than the market average, letting us know that utilities &amp; internet are excluded from the flat fee late, and taking 4 months to send us a video tour of the house yet telling us to sign the tenants' agreement paper ahead of checking the house).

Today, I called him and this happened.

He wanted me to take charge of the internet (registering under my name, payment of the sum collected from the boys every month) since he's been feeling lots of pressure on utilities &amp; cleaning the house, and managing his academics, extracurriculars and stuff. We talked back and force but it's a lot of stories, but in essence, I said I was disappointed in avoiding his responsibilities in this early stage (logics) &amp; thinking this as a reasonable favor on stuff that is already overpriced (possibly taking advantage of our friendship).

Confirmed that his parents putting him as a landlord was fully purposed of their son to grow through challenges throughout, more than a sense of respect for us being tenants or friends.

Basically doesn't have the sense to handle complicated/discomforting situations.

Is it okay to back off and find another place where lines are respected and kept? If so, how should I approach this problem?

After the disappointment that was the recent ""historic"" union contract (it's always historic, always mold break, always isn't actually either of those things when historic scrutiny is applied) I can tell that in short time we may all be working for near minimum wage again, if not at. The new contract gave virtually nothing to new hires. Don't know how they expect to slow down turn over and claim these are good jobs to build families with. Everything's bad all over, I guess. But we all had a choice: vote yes for the contract or... Well that was pretty much the only option. Vote yes, or we don' t know what would happen. Had to go there in person too, whereas other groups in the union were allowed to vote through the mail, even after having it requested directly months in advance. Real shrug kind of moment. 

 I love being in a union, would recommend it to any labor force not being paid above median family income, but there's a lot to complain about. There's a lot of dubious thought and decision guiding that gets called democracy. It's still hand over fist better than going it alone.

 Regardless, when the cost of food and housewares and transportation starts climbing around me, I'll take comfort in knowing that at least city policy is looking out for me... To some modest degree.

# City of Seattle Dismisses and Refunds Certain Parking Tickets

## Tickets issued between September 1, 2021 and April 5, 2022 will be voided and refundedCity’s Parking Enforcement Officers did not receive commissions after transfer from SPD to SDOT in September 2021 

**Seattle**  – Today, the City of Seattle announced that it is voiding parking  tickets and refunding paid parking tickets issued between September 1,  2021 and April 5, 2022, through a third party administrator. Refunds  will be returned to approximately 100,000 individuals who received and  paid for parking tickets during this period. An additional approximately  100,000 ticket recipients who have not yet paid will have their ticket  voided, effective immediately. Refunds to those impacted are set to  begin the week of June 6.

Prior  to September 1, 2021, Parking Enforcement Officers (PEOs) were housed  within the Seattle Police Department (SPD). After nearly 50 years of  being housed in SPD, on November 23, 2020, the City Council passed  Ordinance 126233 to move PEOs to the City of Seattle Communications  Center (CSCC). Later, on July 28, 2021, the Durkan administration  transmitted legislation to the City Council to instead transfer PEOs to  the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT).

On  August 16, 2021, Council Bill 120148 was passed unanimously by the City  Council and signed on August 18, 2021, officially moving PEOs from SPD  to SDOT. Council intended special commissions to be issued for City  employees who were not within SPD to enforce certain aspects of the  traffic code. Special commissions are issued by the Chief of Police to  personnel who perform law enforcement responsibilities outside of SPD.  This technical step was not taken immediately upon PEOs’ relocation to  SDOT in 2021.

Upon  learning that these special commissions had not been properly issued,  the Harrell administration issued a directive to SPD and SDOT to  complete the commissions. Completed commissions for all PEOs were  delivered by April 5th. Parking tickets issued after April 5th are  consistent with the City’s Ordinance and are unaffected by this action.

Due  to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Seattle Municipal Court suspended certain  actions related to unpaid parking tickets, including those issued  between September 1, 2021 and April 5, 2022. The Municipal Court also  suspended any credit card fees for individuals that paid their tickets  via credit card. For those that contested their parking citations, all  hearings occurred telephonically or remotely with the assigned  magistrate.  Furthermore, the Municipal Court did not report or send  unpaid tickets to collections during the COVID-19 emergency period,  which remains in effect.

The  City has been working to remedy tickets and fines issued during the  non-commissioned period. The City retained a third-party administrator  to support its efforts to issue refunds as appropriate and provide  customer support. As a result, no action is necessary for affected  individuals to receive a refund. The City has also established a [website](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA2MDEuNTg3NzgyMjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZWF0dGxlLmdvdi9wYXJraW5nLXRpY2tldC1yZWZ1bmRzP3V0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSJ9.6Y3Cmfg78kQCCQp_oqL8gbXaQEIPvRWTCEb3b8ig08U/s/990875520/br/132267610478-l)  with more information for those with tickets or who may have received  tickets during this period. The City is continuing to review and confirm  actions taken by City staff and PEOs during the relevant time period.

One of the dogs was a large pit bull that looked very similar to the ones that recently mauled the woman in Eastlake. It didn't feel safe to continue walking past them, so I had to turn around and change my walk.

I looked into reporting it, but apparently there is zero way to actually enforce leash violations on homeless dog owners. According to [Seattle Animal Control site](https://www.seattle.gov/animal-shelter/animal-control#failuretoleashapetcatsandpigeonsexcluded), I'm supposed to: 

1. *Contact the owner of the animal, let them know the pet was loose and try to work out a solution in a neighborly manner....* 

* OK, sure... let me just waltz right into a drug encampment with a loose pit bull and work it out with my ""neighbors"". I'm sure that'll go splendidly.

2. *If the violations continue, you may submit a complaint using the* [***service request form***](https://seattle-cwiprod.motorolasolutions.com/cwi/tile)*. We will send a letter to the pet owners advising them that a complaint has been filed and educating them on the applicable Seattle Municipal Code. Please allow 14 days for the pet owner to receive the letter and abate the problem.*

* Aha, brilliant! I'll just use their handy service request form, and they will then follow up by mailing a letter to the public green space where these bums with a loose pit bull live. I'm sure that letter will arrive and will be taken seriously enough to do the trick! 

3. *If the violation occurs again, please submit another complaint using the service request form. An officer will contact the pet owner and provide suggestions and resources to address the problem. They will also issue a verbal warning and will contact you to let you know that has been done and send you a declaration form.* 

* Phew... it's such a relief to know that step three is the same as step two but includes a stern talking to. These people are known to respond well to verbal warnings. 

4. *The final step is for you to complete a declaration form. This form allows you to give Seattle Animal Shelter a written statement of the complaint, as well as the basis for any legal action that the City may pursue against the pet owner. All complainants must be willing to testify in court and be able to verify that the information contained in the declaration is true and correct.*

My takeaway is that there is no way whatsoever that any animal control will be enforced on homeless dog owners in this city.

* SR 20 North Cascades Highway: A small area of the highway west of the pass between Marblemount and Newhalem is down to one alternating lane because of large cracks in the road (see pic below) that formed after winter flooding, freezing and thawing. There is a temporary traffic signal in place that we'll be manually staffing Friday and Monday to adjust the timing to try to keep traffic moving, but expect some delays, be patient and safe. Repairs on this section are scheduled for June.
* SR 109 toward the coat: The highway approaching the Grass Creek Bridge (mileposts 6.3-6.5) between Hoquiam and Ocean Shores is down to one-way alternating traffic and a 25 mph speed limit. Our bridge crews recently were inspecting the bridge and found advanced deterioration of timber pilings under the southbound lanes of the bridge. The closure is in place until further notice while we develop a repair plan. Any vehicle/load under 200,000 pounds is still OK to use the bridge, just, again, be patient, take it slow and be safe.

Unfortunately, our potential congressional representative here doesn't realize that what she's suggesting is a criminal conspiracy under RCW 9A.28.040 and a violation of the federal RICO act that carries with it a 20 year sentence.

Pretty sure she's going nowhere but it's kind of funny when someone is blatantly breaking the law just with their campaign platform.

Anyways, what’s the situation on the ground like there? I watched a video focused on the area about a month ago and here’s what I remember.

Higher interest rates are expected to slow the increase costs of houses but not reverse them. I think last year houses went up by double digit value and the prediction for 2022 is that they’re still going to go up but maybe by just high single digits and not &gt; 10%

There was something about the inventory of housing… there was a term that was pretty much how many months would it take to sell all the houses currently on the market if none were added. This number is still apparently very very low, like I think the lowest in a decade? I’m estimating the numbers from memory here but the gist was something like: when this number is &gt; 16 months it favors buyers and when it’s &lt; 16 months it favors sellers and western Washington is at like 3 months or something…

What’s the situation on the ground there? Is it dire still? I’m not thrilled that I’m going to buying into these way higher interest rates… are there still crazy bidding wars on everything?

For a city that is thought of as progressive, so many people have made a huge point about their hatred towards those less fortunate than them. I don't care what your reasoning is, most of it is just classist BS thinly veiled with ""no I just don't want my neighborhood to have litter in it!"". Like okay, so what are you doing to stop it? Have you considered perhaps organizing neighborhood cleanups for litter? Have you organized anything to help those people get better resources? And don't give me that ""they don't want to stop doing drugs/get a job/whatever"" crap, because it's so unbelievably brain dead. You know why apartments want you to make three times your rent? It's not because they want you to have a high quality life, it's that they don't want to house people they deem as tenants who will damage their property and do drugs living in their apartments. Minimum wage is still awful when compared to the cost of living in Seattle. Your city is at fault for this, not the individuals who suffer the consequences.

So I pose the question to you; why live here when you can afford to live plenty of other places? You can go live in a luxurious McMansion suburb somewhere and retire in peace. Seattle is insanely expensive. If you can afford to live here, you can afford to live most other places, besides maybe San Francisco or New York city, but you're not going to escape homeless people there either, because surprise! The high cost of living in those cities also displaces people. 

I understand if you don't want to feel at risk in your city. I'm a 20 year old woman with a small frame who has to walk places alone at night semi-regularly. However, in my time in Seattle, I have received more screamed compliments about my hair color from homeless people than I have ever felt unsafe due to them. For the most part, they are kind people with unfortunate circumstances. Many of them need psychiatric medications that they cannot afford. Y'all should be glad I can afford mine, because otherwise this post would be quite a bit more angry. I think it would benefit some of y'all to gain some compassion and maybe develop your sociological imagination rather than complain about ""hobos"" and people doing drugs. If you are not actively supporting causes to help people, be quiet or go somewhere else. 

These people are almost never a threat to you. If you are so concerned about crime and drug use, city life will probably never be for you. This is how our country is and yes, it absolutely stinks that there are any homeless people! However, it stinks for THEM far far more than it stinks for you. I am sorry that being around poor people is so uncomfortable for you, but that feeling is not because those people are any more dangerous or unhinged than people who have money. We're in the PNW, home of the serial killers, so be glad you aren't dealing with them instead!

It happens **every single day** in Seattle and we have Cassie Trueblood, a public defender, to thank.

Trueblood filed a lawsuit saying it's ""cruel"" to allow mentally ill inmates to 'languish' in jail without mental health treatment.  While that sounds reasonable, the infrastructure was not in place to handle the fallout after the courts agreed with her.   From that point on, if Western State Hospital doesn't have any available beds to give to these inmates, they are released back to the streets, untreated.  When she was asked about the safety of the community when these violent people are released from jail without treatment, she had no comment.  In other words, not her problem.

Western State Hospital is the only forensic mental health facility on this side of the mountains and the only option our jails have.  

I work with the chronically homeless and see this frequently.  A man named John with paranoid type schizophrenia slashed another man with a machete because he believed he was from the FBI.  The victim was taken to Harborview and John was arrested for 1st Degree Assault with a Weapon.  Western State Hospital has a waiting list for inmates and John was added to the very long list.  Because of the long waiting list, and thanks to the Trueblood decision, John was released from jail and told to ""check himself into Western State"" when a bed opened.   John has schizophrenia and doesn't think he needs help so he went right back to the encampment, now convinced the FBI had people there trying to hurt him and he stabbed another man who was sleeping in a tent.  Thankfully the man was not seriously injured.  John went back to jail.  Still a waiting list at WSH.  John was released from jail again, still untreated and prone to violence.   

This is largely why we are seeing articles in the news about mentally ill people committing crimes after recent arrests for other crimes.  It's not the Governor's fault.  It's not the jail's fault.  It isn't the Prosecutor's fault.   It is due to a public defender and Western State Hospital.

I would really ideally like to live on my own. Size of the apartment does not matter, and i dont need a lot of amenities. I just need somewhere that is safe and looks at least decent.

I'm not sure where else to look. I've tried fb marketplace and apartment websites but have been running into radio silence and housing scams.

* The Montlake Bridge will be fully closed from 11 pm tonight (Friday) until 5 am Monday to finish the project that is replacing the 20-year-old metal grid deck on the bridge. The detour from north of the bridge to get to I-5 is going north on 25th Ave. NE to NE 75th St. and west to I-5; from south of the bridge to get to the north side of the bridge, use northbound I-5 and exit at NE 65th St. At least one sidewalk will be open on the bridge for pedestrians/cyclists and single-leaf openings will be available for boats (for double-leaf we need 24-hour notice so call 206-720-3048). We do know this is University District Street Fair weekend and that this is an inconvenience for that but between weather and other upcoming events, this was the best available weekend to get this done.
* After two weekends of rain postponements we'll finally be able to get going on Revive I-5 work replacing dozens of expansion joints on southbound I-5. Lane reductions will start at about 7:30 pm Friday just south of I-90 and by 10 pm southbound I-5 will be done to one lane near Spokane Street until 5 am Monday. This is the first of about 16 weekends of work this summer.
* The I-5 express lanes will also have a delayed opening Saturday as we do scupper cleaning on the Ship Canal Bridge. The express lanes will open at 4:15 p.m.

So yeah, that's a lot. There's never a good time to close lanes for work but with a short window weather-wise to get this done, we need to take advantage of every dry weekend we can. We do the best we can to avoid most major events but it's impossible to avoid them all and still get work done so we ask people to plan ahead, add extra time to their trips, use transit if you can and be super alert for people biking and walking on this (hopefully) sunny weekend.

Typical ambient city noise is fine... but lots of construction or heavy traffic in the late hours with honking would be problematic for a light sleeper like myself. The landlord says it's fairly calm (more foot traffic on weekends and the occasional sirens), but I'd like other opinions.

I’ve been reading up rental laws that passed in Seattle last November but I can’t seem to get a straight answer.

Things to note:
-my lease ends in October 
-they sent me an electronic notification to sign a new lease in my apartment complex portal at the end of march 

I saw sources that said my apartment complex has to give 180 days notice to increase my rent and they had to do it via certified mail. Does anyone know if the certified mail part is true? If so, that means they’re under the 180 days, what do I do then?

Also, I asked them when I got notifications to sign paperwork in my portal, I logged in but couldn’t find anything at the end of march to early April. I emailed my complex about it, and they never responded. I just found out what it was and emailed them immediately to confirm rates, dates, etc. does that count as a notice?

Does the entirety of the three laws go into effect if they give you notice before July 1 even if your renewal is well past July 1? Also, does anyone have resources on getting legal tenant help for someone that can answer these questions since it doesn’t seem to be clear cut and dry in the legislation?

Coming home today I was cut off and almost got into a wreck. I flipped the guy off and at the next light he got out and tried to punch my rear view mirror. When that didn’t work, he kicked it and broke the mirror housing.

He then tried to block me from taking pics of his plates and ended up rear ending the person in front of him (next to me). 

When we tried to get him to pull over to a gas station so we could stop blocking traffic, he ran. The other car he rear ended took off after him and cornered him in a parking lot until the cops came.

Turns out Seattle won’t arrest people for this. I’m being told that I need to wait for the police report to get the guys info and then reach out to him to get him to pay for my mirror.

My boyfriend has a job he is thinking about taking in the next few months in Seattle! We have both never been to Washington, so we are visiting next week and I just have a few questions…

First and foremost, we love beer and I am in the brewing industry (brewer). We have a list of places to try out, but also I’ve been looking at places online that are hiring. Is there any brewery we/I should avoid? For reasons of poor management, not so good treatment of employees, etc. I like to support the friendly places and I’d like to work for someone that’s not completely intolerable. 

We are looking at some suburbs for houses. We’d prefer to buy and have a pretty decent price range for a house (even greater based on what I can get paid at said future brewing job). We have a dog so we are looking for a place with a yard, and preferably 2 bed, 2 bath and a garage (or at least room in the yard for a shed)… we are thinking Redmond or Columbia City area? But I also love a community so somewhere where we have just that. Independent shops, local restaurants and bars, can make friends, etc. Driving to work isn’t a huge issue (not like hours, but 20-40 miles outside of Seattle is fine;closer is also cool). I also want to be somewhere generally safe walking my dog at night. 

FOOD. We have such a long list of places to visit after searching this sub! But if there is anywhere super special, please let me know. We are not picky eaters at all. Also, nice local and cute coffee shops? 

We plan to do a few outdoorsy type things as well. Hikes and the coast. Maybe some cute parks? Places for dogs to play? How dog friendly is Seattle/surrounding areas?

What’s the snow (or lack of? I don’t know) like? I have lived in Colorado before and adore the cold weather/snow. 

And last, we are partly deciding on our next location to be home indefinitely. I have dreams to open my own brewery and he wants to eventually work with ocean/environmental conservation. Are the opportunities available to some degree? 

Oh also, any just tourist/vacation type stuff to do!? Haha we want to do a little more than just all “business”

Firstly I’m in Bellingham not Seattle. I’m subbed to this Sub because I like to know of cool events/ places to see down south for dates, fun nights, etc. 

Bellingham follows in Seattles footsteps quite frequently and we too have seen more and more homelessness in the area. I understand these subs are helpful to share community discussion and to help bring about change and homelessness is a problem worth solving. I hope that those posting “RVs and tents at this place” sort of posts are doing so to show where people are who need help. I understand that some people take use  and rely on public areas more than intended. Some abuse it. But many are people who need help to get better and it can take their entire life to reintegrate back into life off the streets. These  people are and always will be people. They have real lives and needs that aren’t so different than yours. Please if you have ideas on how to help comment below.

Only last year people have been saying how this won't change anything.

Well glad it is finally being rolled back, whoever has been calling legislators to roll these laws back can pat themselves on the back for a job well done for the community.

Condemnation of blighted property.

Every county, city, and town may acquire by condemnation, in accordance with the notice requirements and other procedures for condemnation provided in Title 8 RCW, any property, dwelling, building, or structure which constitutes a blight on the surrounding neighborhood. A ""blight on the surrounding neighborhood"" is any property, dwelling, building, or structure that meets any two of the following factors: (1) If a dwelling, building, or structure exists on the property, the dwelling, building, or structure has not been lawfully occupied for a period of one year or more; (2) the property, dwelling, building, or structure constitutes a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare as determined by the executive authority of the county, city, or town, or the designee of the executive authority; or (3) the property, dwelling, building, or structure is or has been associated with illegal drug activity during the previous twelve months. Prior to such condemnation, the local governing body shall adopt a resolution declaring that the acquisition of the real property described therein is necessary to eliminate neighborhood blight.

The video shows that as protesters begin walking up the church steps toward the security guard, who stands in their path, one woman falls down the stairs, which prompts other protesters to accuse the security guard of having pushed her. The video does not show whether the security guard pushes her or not.

The protesters then shout expletives at the security guard. A police officer then steps between the security guard and the protesters on the steps. One of the protesters can be heard on the video saying that the group planned to deliver a stack of coat hangers to the church, an apparent reference to claims that overturning Roe would signal a return to illicit “back alley” abortions.

In a statement to CNA, the Archdiocese of Seattle disputed the claim that the demonstrator was pushed down the stairs.

Right now I’m a guy who’s 28 that is not in a great place and I live in a housing project with some pretty dysfunctional people around me. I recently lost my full-time Job and got on unemployment. I showed up to work everyday on time Monday through Friday for a little over a year and was liked by the job trainer and told I performed my tasks well. However, for one reason or another which management chose not to disclose to me they decided to let me go.

I am always drug &amp; alcohol free, have a clean record, good job history, and professional references.   


What I’m looking for:

l would like to move to a place that’s safe and has a good job market. I don’t have much experience and no higher education but I’d be willing to learn a trade or some other profession which is in demand.   


Overall I just want to live in a place with opportunities for low-income people that are serious about starting a career. In my research I’ve found Seattle has very little of this due to gutted budgets and lack of investment to support people who dont have a nest egg to just solely commit all their time to a program. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I just feel trapped where I’m at due to my financial limitations and I’d like to unshackle myself from this place and take myself to a better environment.

I currently live in Sacramento. For a bit of context, I am currently trying to leave an abusive relationship, and I'm in the stages of creating my safety plan with the local DV shelter here and my therapist. This is my 5th attempt to leave and it has been decided that I need to completely disappear from this person's life with no trace. I will be moving with the belongings that can fit in my car, potentially with help from my step-dad and a uHaul (Living with my parents is not an option. They also live in another state. I am isolated here. I dont really have any friends either, just surface level/fairweather type of friends.) As well as my cat. 

Seattle has been calling my name for a lot of reasons. Namely, the weather is my favorite. I absolutely love fog and rain and overcast days, and nature. Secondly, I started a charity organization for adolsecents and young women that is still in the smaller phases and I feel this would do well in Seattle given the political climate there. Third, I love that there is still a lot of affluence there, the big city feel, but still with intimate spaces like bookstores and coffee shops. I've never visted..but everything I see and hear about Seattle just pulls me in. Everyone I talk to about my dream of living there always says they could see me there. 

Now, here is the issue. I know Seattle is very expensive. I have considered Portland for this reason. I'm working with a fairly limited budget for moving as most of my finances are controlled by soon-to-be Ex and I have been squireling away as much as I can. I'm currently sitting on about 7k that I need to use very carefully and sparingly. I'm not sure how I'm going to find a job out there or an apartment since most apartments have income requirements. I have an Associate Degree and in the process of getting my BS in Business Administration (and a passion for helping others on a non-profit administration of level. If that matters at all..) 

I guess my question here is... do you feel like relocating to Seattle given my current situation is realistic, or is it just a pipe dream? If so.. where should I consider moving to? It needs to be fairly close to Sacramento since I don't think my car will hold up for a much longer drive than that. If I should plan for Seattle, what are some resources that might be available to me? 
I am super lost/overwhelmed and would really appreciate some guidance if anyone would be willing to offer some to me.

This morning at the Greenwood post office I walked in with a single package and tucked into the short line of 2 people. 
I realized I hadn't put my return address on the package, so I grabbed a pen and started scawling that on.

As I'm writing a woman walks in let's call her Karen. She  Takes a quick look at me, and then gracefully wedges herself in the 18"" space between myself and the person in front of me. I say ""ma'am I'm all set"" and she replies ""ok"" and doesn't move.

I can see where this is going since, as I've said, this has happened before. TEN minutes go by and as the second person is finishing up their transaction I go around the opposite side of the island and  position myself behind the guy who is collecting his receipt.

Alas, I am slow and old and underestimated Karen. She flies in there,  literally puts her hands on me to dive me aside and says ""oh no you don't."" When I pointed out in what was likely an impolite way that I was in the post office far before her, she replied that I was clearly not ready when SHE walked in. Ten minutes ago.

So, the moral dilemma is clear: does one's place in the queue not begin until you are 100% ready, or can one keep their place in line as long as you are ready when your turn is up? Karen and I clearly disagree, and she is as sure as I am of being vindicated by reddit. 

She was very angry and continued to berate my audacity throughout her transaction.  I'm an equally terrible person and returned her sentiments in kind, which made for an uncomfortable 3 minutes for the poor staff.

If you've been to the Greenwood post office, there's an angel named Sonia there who makes it her job to ensure everyone's day is better for having interacted with her. She came out and gave me a hug and a slice of carrot cake, which was vindication enough. ❤",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,269468,public,confidence,self,Do I not understand how post office lines work in Seattle?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/uj22af/do_i_not_understand_how_post_office_lines_work_in/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are some pet peeves that constantly get triggered here that I’ve never seen in the rest of the country:

1. Driving slowly in the HOV/left-most lane. I thought that was the fast lane, only to be stuck behind drivers that cruise at the speed limit or even drive slower than the other lanes. 
2. Stopping or hesitating at green lights. It’s a green light, and last time I checked, green light means GO. 
3. Blowing red lights: speaks for itself 
4. Not knowing how to check blind spots. One too many times have I almost got merged on. This is seriously so dangerous and can cause accidents. 
5. Stopping in the middle of the street and turning in your hazard lights. Yea, I guess drivers feel entitled to block traffic for their deliveries and Uber rides when they can pull up to the curb to do so.

I've worked as a security guard here in the city for the past 3 years. I take public transportation to and from work every day, and I've seen and experienced some shit.

Assaults every other day, people smoking foil literally every time I ride the bus and forcing me and everyone else in the bus to breathe that toxic shit. People shitting in the streets and cops completely ignoring it. I've even been witness to 2 different murders on 3rd street that were like a week apart.

I stopped using the E-line and my old bus stops because last time I was there, some crazy homeless guy threatened to shoot me and everyone else there. New bus takes literally twice as long, but it has no crackheads on it and no violent incidents so far, so it's worth it. 

But the thing that gets under my skin and grinds my gears like nothing else is all these people in the other sub who are spinning this fantasy,

""It's not that bad, Republicans just exaggerate.""
""It's just part and parcel of living in the city. We're nowhere near as bad as New York or LA!""
""I've lived here 15 years and I've NEVER seen anything bad or felt unsafe.""

It's ridiculous. Other places being worse does not make what's happening here acceptable.

I am relocating to the Seattle area for work soon (office is in Bellevue) from Savannah GA. I have searched through both this subreddit and the Bellevue one and cannot seem to find a lot of info applicable to me. It also appears that there is quite a divide between people who like Seattle and Bellevue? I would love info from those that have been in the area for some time so I can try to decide between Seattle or Bellevue. Looking for rent below 2500, which from the research I have done seems doable.

I am a 31 year old male. No kids, and my wife passed away so this will be a completely solo move. I know no one in the area. I would like to be somewhere within walking distance of things to do after work and on the weekends (restaurants, a bar or 2, a nice walkable park or something, and maybe a good walkable street venue?). I walk a lot, and 1.5 miles is about what I consider walkable in one go. I spend a fairly balanced amount of time between checking out the surrounding town, and staying in my own home playing video games. I am also into muscle cars and motorcycles.

So my main questions between Seattle and Bellevue are this (I would also consider outlying areas if applicable):

1. Is the difference between stuff to do in Seattle and Bellevue really that big of a deal?
2. Is there a big difference in lifestyles between the 2 areas?
3. How bad is traffic commuting from home in Seattle to work in Bellevue?
4. How unsafe is Seattle compared to Bellevue?
5. What do people consider ""young"" when they explain these things? I don't think I count as young, but also not old.
6. Is salt used on the road in the winter?
7. Is the Seattle freeze really that bad as far as making new connections?
8. Any neighborhood or location suggestions for either Seattle or Bellevue are welcomed.
9. Any words of caution about stuff I should know before moving?

I should also note that I have lived in New England, Cleveland OH, Savannah GA, and North Carolina if that helps with comparisons of things.

I know in Seattle, they need to give 180 days notice before the increase. Here's where I'm not sure if they did it or not.

They gave the notice about the increase on 4/19/2022 . My lease expires on the 10/09/2022.

I'm bad with numbers but I'm pretty sure they missed the time frame to give me proper notice? 
Can they still increase my rent? How do I respond if they're wrong?

To be honest, reading this subreddit and r/seattle I am a bit discouraged as it seems a bit more dangerous from what I am expecting. I was in Seattle a couple of times and felt safe, but living there is different than just visiting it for a couple of weeks. 

Can you recommend us safe neighbourhoods where we could get a nice two bedroom apartment for up to 3k USD/month? We are not much into clubbing but we'd like to have nice coffee shops, gyms and restaurants within walking distance? 

Commuting is not an issue as we will be mostly working from home but we also don't want to be isolated as we don't know anyone there, and we'd like to explore as much as possible, at least in the first couple of months.

I wanted to get a better understanding of this topic, and whether or not it's a good idea. So I talked to some local organizers and created some educational content about the issue:

* First, I talked to Logan Bowers, who is one of the main organizers with SeattleApproves. He told me all about why he thinks Approval Voting would be a good idea. 

**The case for Approval Voting: https://youtu.be/V2RygyJV0kQ**

However, some people are concerned that Approval Voting could have unintended consequences, such as further marginalizing communities of color.

* So I also sat down and spoke with Kamau Chege, an organizer with Washington Community Alliance (a group focused on building an equitable multiracial democracy) about why he thinks Approval Voting would be a mistake for Seattle. 

**The case against Approval Voting: https://youtu.be/4Z9v4GcUtjA**

Here’s my assessment so far. The work environment has nothing good to offer except dysfunction, poor morale, and apathy. Turnover is alarmingly high and most if not all employees are looking for a way out to a better situation. If you notice a high turnover rate in your company or department, take that as a sign of a toxic workplace. The turnover here is the worst I've been involved with. I was fully expecting the startup job routine to be tough but boy did I underestimate how terrible this culture is. I don't know where to start. Everything is so unimaginably disorganized and backward I can't describe it. To quote an example, the website had been hacked and the data was such a mess we couldn't even easily figure out what customer data was exposed by the hackers. Other data systems are so poorly kept up and organized that when I try to bring some measures to fix these issues, there is pushback at all levels. Willful immatureness at all levels especially in my group and my floor.

Turns out the CEO is actually a terrible person and he treats everyone like crap (except for some employees who I overheard he has had ""personal relationships"" with). I personally refer to the CEO as the Mad King. The toxicity here percolates through all levels of people at this business. Everyone fears this guy but care about nothing else—only if the mad king is in a good mood or not. People abuse each other openly as a matter of daily routine.  There's constant toxic office gossip, backstabbing and maneuvering. It's politics and closed door meetings. They absolutely hate new hires like (me) who were hired from outside because god knows why. Few weeks after I started one coworker bragged to me that they got people fired as some sort of badge of honor or intimidation factor. This isn't even the wildest part. This is the same ring leader person openly rags on everyone. I only imagine what they say about me when I'm not in the room. They bragged they won’t get fired because they are ""friends"" with ceo. we'll see about that.

Meetings are mostly complaining about how messed up things are and who was fired or quit this week. Nobody listens to their manager or follows any timelines. Drugs use seems to be a part of the company culture because people openly talk about it during meetings and in the hall; even in front of managers. You’ll never seem to get the necessary information to do your job because the communication is top down and broken. So far nothing has been approved to improve the duct-taped systems and platforms that are in place. It seems like they don't want to spend the money. I’ve been told more than once that I should feel lucky to have a job at all here. Which sounds crazy, b/c they can barely keep people.

When you look around the office there's never anyone who appears to be happy. The class clown I'll call them is like this: likable, funny, and has tons of stories to tell, but nobody can stand them and tries to avoid them because they are manipulative. Most of the people in my department are downright miserable to be working here. Everyone is out for themselves because of the lack of unified processes and the disorganization. Honestly, the negativity and inexperienced leadership makes my job miserable and everyday I’m wondering what I just got myself into (and how do I get outta here quick.)

Anyone thinking about working here should consider their tolerance for questionable or unethical behavior and should have a high threshold of comfortability walking or crossing the thin line of regulatory compliance, including with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. There's nothing that tells me that the company is interested in my safety or they want me to stay here more than a few months.  I have growing suspicions that our products are not exactly how they are represented to the public because of the jokes and comments from my team and other teams. The person who had my job before me told me that he witnessed employees getting called 'stupid' or 'dumb' in meetings by upper management and people crying. The day I leave, I will be actually somewhat relieved that I don't have to come to this office ever again.  It's an unstable sh!tshow. Word to the wise.

I am getting married in September and having a bachelor weekend August 12-15.  Coming from the Twin Cities, I have been tasked with picking a destination by Sunday and getting some ideas of what I would like to get out of my weekend.  Other than that my group (1 gay male and 5 straight woman if that matters) will handle the rest.

I have landed on either Seattle or Portland, two places Ive been dreaming of visiting!  Ive only been to Vancouver BC in the PNW and it hands down was one of my most favorite places Ive ever traveled to.

I have been reading a few reddit threads about bachelor parties in Seattle with most people looking down on the idea. And from what I can gather its mostly due to Washingtons strip club rules.  I don't think that would be an issue for me as I don't think I would end up at one anyways (maybe a gay one if they have them?).  

But otherwise, I want to be close to water, eat seafood, eat like locals, explore the cities neighborhoods and have one hard night out in the cities gayborhood (or area with the highest concentration of gay bars within walking distance).  Seattle sounds like it fits the bill but I'm equally open to the idea of Portland if you still think that it is the better idea.  I would make time for a half day trip to the coast in Oregon to get my water fix.

If y'all think Seattle is a good choice, some ideas of neighborhoods to check out and stay in, activities to do (hot tub boat looks really cool, but I have seven people), and must eat seafood places (oysters, scallops, shrimp and clams are my favorites) would be fabulous.

DM me if interested with resume and tell me about yourself. I will pre-screen you if you have the background to be a potential good fit.

Technically the apartment is still ""liveable"" since I can still use the toilet/shower if I climb over some machines.

Filed a claim with renters insurance to see if they would pay for it, and someone called me back just now to schedule an appointment for tomorrow to talk about whether they would do that.

This whole experience has been pretty stressful and upsetting. It feels like I've had no power since I dont have money to take care of myself better. Been relying on the kindness of my BF and his roommates letting me stay in his room.

Do I have grounds to get my rent discounted for the 5 days and nights I wasn't able to stay there? Or am I SOL?

I realize this may not be the best place to ask for guidance on this, so if you can suggest a different place for me to do research/ask questions, please do so. I live in Bellevue, btw.

Drivers will need to plan other routes if they use that ramp so please give our blog a read for details.

I’m living in South Lake Union at the moment. Usually I go twice a week to the Eastside to do my grocery shopping, but with gas at ridiculously high prices I’m trying to stay a little closer to my neighborhood. 

I’ve got the new PCC downtown as well as the Mercer Island Met Market (every time I’ve been to LQA they’re out of at least one thing I need). I go to the Northgate Target for household goods and basic pantry staples. Trader Joe’s is also not too far away. But I still need a mid-tier grocery store—think QFC or Safeway—that doesn’t suck. 

Yes, I’m quite aware there’s a QFC on Mercer Street, which I work diligently to avoid. The customer service is terrible, and it’s a miracle the health department hasn’t shut down the place. Case in point: [I’m worried that the mold infestation might kill the mice](https://yelp.to/IgyXIUkl3ob).

Part of the reason why crime is at an all time high isn’t because of police defunding, but police unions. Police are not public servants and cannot be fired due to their unions. Want proof, look no further than SF where police were never defunded but it’s not uncommon to see police sitting in their cars watching Macy’s get robbed, and turn a blind-eye to drug dealers in front of a police station. They cannot be fired due to their unions, so they realize it’s better to sit in their cars and get paid $200,000 then to actually do their jobs.

The fact of the matter is even when you have a republican district attorney and increase funding for the police crime will continue to rise, because the increased funding goes into police overtime and pension pay. More officers doesn’t mean anything if they sit in their cars doing nothing all day like in SF. If we want to solve crime we need to privatize the police that way they are beholden to the will of the people and can’t act without impunity.

So ya see, I value my apartment SO MUCH. I also work from home, so I will be there constant. I have 2 options:

\-get an apartment around $1600-2000 and have more savings, but an okayish/good apartment 

OR

\-get this dream apartment in Belltown for around $2340, with less savings but it is everything I have ever wanted in an apartment. I'm talkin laundry in unit, gorgeous views of the ocean, great shopping &amp; walking, concrete floors and modern fixtures etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also did the math, and out of the 8k savings I make in 5/6 months, I could use $3300 to make up the difference (as if I was paying \~$2000 instead of $2340 every month). 

I calculated all of my expenses and even overcompensated for groceries, CO insurance, utilities (Estimating around $300 for ea.)

1 Reimbursed for cost of the hotels that we had to stay at while trying to find another place to live

2 The cost or a portion of the costs for the meals since we had to eat out for every meal.

3 The return of our application fee

4 Damages for breaking the agreement we signed to offer us a move in ready apartment.

We have all of the documents, texts with the building super and mgmt, pics and receipts that were involved in this fiasco.

Hello all,

I have a DR650 that needs a bit of maintenance done! I am mechanically decent but have only worked on cars mostly. The main things I want to address are valve check / adjustment and fork seal replacements. It would be really nice to have someone help me out, as I can probably do it fine on my own and have watched the videos on how to do it on YouTube. Would be cool to have someone with more experience be able to have a set of eyes on it and assist me / teach me.

I work professionally in IT support and can help you with all sorts of computer related things from optimizing your home network, building PC's, helping you with programming, and general troubleshooting. I also have some other skills like music production.

I also have no issue working with you to find a fair price for helping / doing it, the reason I'm asking for help rather than going to a shop is because I'd prefer to learn to do it myself!

Thanks and maybe if you can't help I would appreciate you passing this along to one of your mechanically inclined friends.",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,266851,public,confidence,self,"Looking for motorcycle maintenance (DR650) help, willing to trade for computer help / mentoring (well versed in many technlogies) or just straight cash and beer",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tvpd55/looking_for_motorcycle_maintenance_dr650_help/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Take in the benefits of Kambo while surrounded by the support of community. Intro breath work, embodied movement, and vegan food included.

Kambo, known as the ""Vaccine of the Rainforest"", is an ancient shamanic remedy that hails from the depths of the Amazon. It is non-psychoactive and is simply the secretion of phyllomedusa bicolor, or the giant monkey tree frog.

Although kambo has been used for thousands of years amongst different tribes in Peru and Brazil, it has only gained notoriety in the western world in recent decades. Kambo is host to an impressive cocktail of bioactive and neuroactive peptides which hold powerful treatment potential for a myriad of physical, mental, and spiritual ailments. See full list of kambo's peptides at the end of this post.

Kambo is best described as a detoxing purgative, and the experience can be quite uncomfortable. The frog secretion is deeply cleansing, and is best received ceremonially with intention and under the care of a certified and trained practitioner.

Jetta is certified through Kambo International. She is also a yoga teacher, India-trained Thai Bodywork Practitioner, reiki healer, angel channel, and intuitive light worker.

In addition to Kambo, she offers shamanic bodywork sessions, astrological counseling, as well as coaching to support spiritual ascension and plant medicine integration.

She has traveled the world studying and living different healing modalities, and hopes to be a catalyst for others on their journey towards oneself. She believes in the practice of Seva (selfless service) and practices Bhakti yoga.

KAMBO SCIENCE AND USES.

Neuro and Bio Active Peptides in Kambo:

Dermorphin - Dermorphin has an opiate like effect on mu-opioid receptors, making it a very potent painkiller with effects 30-40 times stronger than morphine.

Deltorphin - Deltorphin is also a powerful painkiller and delta opioid agonist.

Phyllomedusin - A neuropeptide that has a powerful effect on intestines and bowels, contributing to the purging often experienced when taking kambo.

Phyllokinin - This neuropeptide can cause a long lasting reduction in blood pressure.

Phyllocaerulein - Another potent painkiller that reduces blood pressure and affects thermoregulation.

Adenoregulin - A 33 amino acid peptide that works with the adenosine receptor. This antibiotic peptide can have harm-reducing effects against a myriad of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, including cancer cells.

Dermaseptin - Induces potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria, yeast, fungi, protozoa, and enveloped viruses that often cause severe opportunistic infections.

Tryptophyllins - Highly potent against the yeast candida, may have potential in cardiovascular, inflammatory and anticancer therapy.

The properties of kambo peptides make it a promising treatment for the following conditions:

• Depression

• Migraines

• Blood circulation problems

• Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease

• Vascular insufficiency

• Organ diseases

• Cancer - Tumors

• Fertility problems

• Deeply rooted toxins

Hello everyone.

I am an international student. A month ago, when I went back to my hometown for a vacation, a roommate, we rented the same house and both had our own rooms. He broke into my room and stole my computer. I'm pretty sure he sold it to someone. Because I wasn't in the US at the time and I didn't have any evidence to report to the police. So I'm just hoping someone who has seen or bought the thing in the picture contact me so I can report it to the police. I won't take it back because you bought it. I just want to call the police to arrest my roommate. He is a threat of theft wherever he goes. As an international student I am not allowed to find a job and that computer is all I have, I hope to get help from anyone who can get him arrested and compensate me . Thanks for reading.

I live in Rainier Beach 98118

I think money should be spent on bus tickets out of town, while The Jungle at least made the crisis ""out of sight, out of mind"".

Instead of incarceration, a program (hell, people would callit a ""progrom"" since it is kind of heartless) of late night sweeps of encampemts by police would first make it known that as a populace we are done with the homeless shennanigans. A few months of this would hopefully encourage people to try Portland or somewhere else--no, I don't care if it is kicking the can down the road since the goal is to clean up our city.

After, police will start arresting vagrants for anything illegal, whether it be suspicion of stolen property, public nuisance/noise/disturbing the peace, drugs/public intoxication/paraphernalia, or trespassing/illegal camping. They can't afford representation, but they will recieve a public defender. During the proceedings they will be offered a plea bargain to attend a diversion program on McNeil where offenders can be ferried over to a low to no security area with maybe some shipping comtainers or tiny houses used for shelter if the decommissioned prison facilities are deemed inhabitable.

Social workers be available in offices out of school portables during normal business hours. Clients will be able to graduate upon a cleared mental health screen and negative drug test.

A constraint is that this will not work if the island is drug free. Some amount of drug traffic must be allowed to supply residents. This can be done legitimately, or at least with a blind eye, by allowing travel by non court ordered individuals on a few times a day ferry. On top of the counselers and drug dealers, nonprofits can continue their missions through food delivery, religious outreach, and needle exchange. This will keep what is now a full-blown industry satisfied.

Another concern would be money for the individuals to purchase food, toiletries and cigarettes from a cantene... with the remaining pocket money to get their drugs. I suppose this is the perfect opportunity to test a universal income. Admission to the program would include a per diem, say $20/day. Some security could be available to prevent what would be ongoing gang violence to gain these funds and manipulate the population. Not doing so would result in the dystopian classic ""No Escape"", fantastic 1994 film starring Ray Liotta.

The state or federal supreme courts would surley rule in favor of any legal challenge so it will never happen.

As I get ready to do my remote consulting on EST I was glancing at the news.

Biden proposed 20% plus Income tax hike on high income earners and wealthy individuals (OK high-income earners (think Goldman Sachs, etc) that is fine); however, most people that are wealthy are wealthy on paper (meaning stocks, etc.) they do not actually earn that much from their companies annually.

But it is the wording of it (which really violates the 16th amendment of the US Constitution) as he is proposing taxing unrealized income. Unrealized income isn’t income until one cashes out. It is an investment in the economy. The billionaires will just find different places to put their money.  
They will find tax shelters or demand real immediate income as opposed to paying taxes on “unrealized” digital gains. This administration will not be limiting this practice to billionaires, they will eventually at some point be coming for your investments – including your 401K and IRAs. Long term investors will not be willing take this additional risk for new innovative startups who cannot pay dividends and property gains as well.

This is a real slippery slope IMHO as how long before it reaches into middle class when $$$ gains from up above do not reach the magical number they want. The reason I put this in SeattleWA reddit is we have multiple billionaires and toes of millionaires in this area (but most of this is paper wealth).

I happily paid over $150K in Federal IRS taxes last year (PM Consultants working remotely make big money) and I never complain because if I am paying it than I am successful (Gen X born to the greatest generation parents aka pre depression) and another 20K to select non-profits with no admin overhead costs.

The idea of taxing unrealized income is ludicrous IMHO and between this and WA Capital Gains tax might drive a lot of businesses out of this area (not to mention the cost of goods). This now becomes double taxing which will likely fall down farther to 100K/year to pay for all the new govt programs promised. 

It will affect and have a direct impact on Seattle due to our lack of a state income tax makes us attractive to working here.

I had a question I tried googling and couldn’t find the answer there or here. I figured I could ask this sub if they had any experiences similar to mine. 

I moved out of my apartment in the summer of 2021. I waited the 21 days required by state and city law for the return of my deposit. 

I received a partial refund no itemized checklist included. After that I requested the return of my full deposit with a deadline after multiple exchanges with the management company refusing to comply. 

I filed in small claims and am awaiting a court date. 

After my deadline they sent another check that didn’t equal the full amount of my security deposit. 

As a last ditch effort to not go to court I filed a complaint with SDCI. 

It seems this alerted the management company because they’re attempting to return my deposit now in March 2022. What is odd to me is they are now stating I owe final utilities for the first time since I moved last summer. I was able to pay rent through out the pandemic.

Many constituents have written to me over the years and more recently as well regarding the several RVs located on SW Andover next to Nucor and the West Seattle Health Club.   A shooting this week highlights the need for additional efforts to address this location. Fortunately, the victim is in stable condition and a suspect is in custody.

Before I get into how I have been trying to address the issues at this location, I need to explain the legal context.  While the City had not been enforcing the 72-hour parking law at all during the COVID pandemic, it is important to note that the decision to limit enforcement of this law towards people living in their vehicles predates the COVID19 moratorium. Even before the enactment of the 72-hour parking law moratorium in response to COVID19 and CDC guidance, SPD had been using discretion, and generally only enforcing the law against people living in their vehicles after outreach and referral efforts, and generally focused on areas specifically selected for the RV remediation program.

This Seattle Times article explains why.  This Washington State Supreme Court case places legal limits on how the City enforces parking laws against individuals living in their vehicles.  This court’s ruling in this lawsuit is the reason why SPD so carefully uses its discretion, rather than simply towing every vehicle in violation of the law.

I have repeatedly advocated for city action at the Andover location, both under the previous administration, and I, in January, confirmed that the new administration was aware of the Andover neighbors’ concerns. On February 9, I met with the Mayors’ Office, SPU, the City Attorney, and SDOT to discuss how SDOT is mostly maintaining the moratorium on enforcement of the 72 hours parking ordinance, and only enforcing as relates to abandoned vehicles. Additionally, in a recent article about RVs in Ballard SDOT was quoted:

“SDOT parking enforcement is continuing to focus on clearing abandoned and unoccupied vehicles,” said press secretary Ethan Bergerson. “SDOT at this time is not impounding vehicles which are occupied by people refusing to relocate.”

The City of Seattle did conduct a clean-up for the area with the SPU RV Remediation program between November 30 and Friday, December 3. At that time, SPU collected 7,600 pounds of debris during their efforts.

Last week I again reached out to Mayor Harrell’s office to follow up on our February meeting about the Andover location and was told last week that: “On 3/3 SPU conducted a site assessment of the Andover location and it is currently ranked high enough for a Remediation next month.” Just like the SDOT quote above about the RV’s in Ballard, the Mayor’s office told me that the planned remediation next month for Andover does not include enforcement of the 72-hour parking ordinance. Additionally, the Mayor’s Office let me know that SDOT is developing a policy for enforcing – when appropriate – the 72-hour parking ordinance for vehicles being used as residences and doing so in a way that addresses the limitations created by the State Supreme Court decision referenced above.

Finally, it’s important to include that last year I helped obtain funding for a “safe lot,” a location for RVs to park. The funding wasn’t implemented by the previous Mayor.  The King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA) now has jurisdiction for homelessness response in both the City of Seattle and throughout King County.   Consequently, the safe lot funding that I championed was transferred from the City of Seattle to the KCRHA.  In January, KCRHA voted on their budget which included the City’s funding for RV Storage and RV Safe Lots. The Request for Proposal will be released this month for almost $2 million, you can see an overview of that here. KCRHA has convened a vehicle residency workgroup that is working on solutions for vehicle residents across a lot of specific subplans, you can see that presentation here.

In addition to regularly calling SPU for garbage pick-ups, RV remediation visits, and septic pump outs, and regularly asking Southwest Precinct Captain Rivera for increased SPD patrols in the area, I repeatedly emphasize to the Executive that the neighbors in this area have had a significant number of RVs as neighbors for 3 years now and deserve some additional attention to address the community impacts.",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,265477,public,confidence,self,Herbold's Response to RV shooting by Nucor,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tog83c/herbolds_response_to_rv_shooting_by_nucor/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here’s what I’m seeing and this is most based on experience and have not timed or calculated numbers scientifically:
1) Many sellers are taking early offers and as a result houses go pending within 1-2 days of being listed. 
2) Increasing number of sellers are not doing pre-inspection on their property. Not all but the percentage of who do vs  don’t is really skewed.
3) Sellers are at this point expecting buyers to waive inspection contingency if not ALL contingencies to be even competitive. 
4) Buyers can do their pre-inspection but given the properties are going pending at crazy rates there is no time and even if the property stays on market long enough and you can get an inspection done, buyers have to shell money out for each offer they put in.

My partner wanted to take the strain to Seattle and go the pike place market area. We never been on a train before, but we took the 7:50am train from the Tacoma Dome Station to King Station. 

Once we got off at King Station there was graffiti and trash littered inside and outside of the tunnel. We started walking to pike place market and we saw quite a few homeless people. This one guy was just laying down next to the pedestrian crosswalk post. His feet were out in the road. Then behind him there were 2 others just laying down on the sidewalk, they looked passed out. Then, I saw a body fully covered with a white blanket / tarp looking material. Really creeped me out and everyone just kept walking by, it seemed normalized?

Then, we go to the waterfront area, near the Seattle Aquarium. There is a cool little spot there with 2 huge games of checkers and chess, nice public bathrooms, and a tiny soccer field for kids. Was really beautiful an we went to Hmart to get some sushi and came back there to eat.

After we went to hmart, we stopped at the Starbucks and while outside waiting / talking, this lady came up asking for a dollar and it could change her life. I said mam I'm sorry, but I don't have any cash, I could get you something from starbucks though if you'd like. She then got mad at me and started saying it's my fault she's like that, etc. Made me feel terrible and she stormed off. 

We were going to take the train back at 2:35, but after that and one the walk back, we saw more bodies just laying on the sidewalks passed out and creepy guys staring at my girl, it just made me so comfortable I just wanted to go home. So we took the 549 at 12:25pm, and it was our first time driving a bus too, but the driver was very nice and apparently I used the piercetransit app instead of the soundtransit app, but I showed him my tickets and all is good. 

I'm not sure if we should go back, it's so beautiful but at the same time, especially the large buildings. I love just looking up in awe at them. 


I used to go  to Safeco Field to watch the mariners when I was younger. I don't remember it being like this, but I was younger.

1. This Chipotle in Redmond, WA: Never was my order prepared on time. Around 30% of the time they forget to prepare my order after which i have to show them order receipt. 

2. I have been to multiple subways. In most subways you'll have your veggies literally thrown in your sub. I'm not asking them to be extra courteous, but if you're preparing the food, at least do it good.

3. I went to this pizza place. They close at 9:00. I ordered online for a pickup and reached there at 8:58 PM. The door was locked. I was literally knocking the glass door for over 5 minutes and what pissed me off was that there were 3 employees sitting inside the restaurant and won't even get up to open the door. Ultimately one person arrived and yelled ""we're close"". After I told her that I ordered online she was like ""email for a refund"".

4. There were some restaurants during the pandemic where the servers or the guy at the reception won't even wear a mask, and after I ask them to, they'll wear a mask but will give me a very mean facial expression. 

Rarely I have encountered any good customer service. I never say or argue about anything, as that would only escalate things and I'm not interested in ruining my day over a server's behavior.

I can understand that no one wants to work on minimum wage, but hey, it's not my problem that I focused on my career and education, and they didn't.

Even though I’ve lived in Seattle for a decade and a half, I’ve never seen so much, so close, so often. Drug use. Extreme despair. People who look dead or close to it.  I follow the police blotters on Twitter and see there are overdose deaths on this street… often. Just the other day there was one on the south end of the street and another on the north end an hour later. 

It’s dangerous out there. I’ve had my front door slammed in my face multiple times, a man screamed at me today that I’m a B**** A** Mary Poppins when I wouldn’t give him a dollar (that one was kind of funny) and recently a guy with a knife in his hand was blocking my front door as a tried to scoot by (It was sad. He had an action figure in his other hand and just wanted to show it to me like he was a little kid.). And a couple of years ago a whole bunch of innocent bystanders got shot when two dealers tried to take each other out.

And yet something clicked in me when I moved to this street. Something in my gut won’t let me walk past the dead bodies anymore. I have to shake them and see if they move. They almost always spring to life or slowly groan, but when they don’t, I call 911. A couple of weeks ago, there was a dead, dead lady on the corner and everyone was screaming they needed Narcan (it can reverse opioid overdoses). No one would call the police, so I called 911 and the operator walked me through CPR. I had never done chest compressions before. At some point she gasped just as a fire truck pulled up. There was a giant crowd around her as I tried to step back, but in hindsight, I think they were doing more chest compressions when I walked away. 

I have an elderly neighbor who stopped me in the hallway the other day who told me I’m going to get murder. This lady marched me across the street two years ago after the big shooting to show me that we mustn’t be afraid. But it seems she has changed her tune. Recently, a 15-year old boy was shot on the corner and he ran to the front of our building where he died. She told me she could see it from her apartment and she could see him there on the ground. She was so mad that I’m putting myself in harm’s way out there even though just a couple of years ago she told me can’t be afraid.

And I am afraid, but I still can’t just walk past the bodies. Today there was a lady in a wheelchair, slumped over with her head against a trash can. I clapped my hands and shouted but she didn’t move. I shook her shoulder and she finally started to sit up. She was alive! I walked away and when I came back about 30 minutes later, she was gone.

I know it’s bad out there, we all do. But, I do think that if you see what looks like a dead body, even if you feel ok walking away, maybe just call 911 and tell them where it is?

My parents would be horrified if they knew where I lived or that I stop to interact with people out there. But as I told my neighbor, I feel like I have to. Sometimes I try to walk away, but I can’t.

Full disclosure: I totally think people should go to jail for selling drugs and I think possessing drugs should be illegal, too. I do think there should be mandatory treatment and I don’t think encampments should be allowed. But I’ve also met with the police and city council and the Downtown Association and I understand how this happened and why it’s still happening and that it’s not getting fixed any time soon. I can’t do anything to fix any of it… but at least I can call an ambulance for the dead bodies.",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,265005,public,confidence,self,I Just Can’t Walk Past The Dead Bodies,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tjtaod/i_just_cant_walk_past_the_dead_bodies/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used a fairly convoluted method to deal with that. **Someone on the forum asked me to elaborate how and why I did that,** so I thought I'd make a post.

When we started dating, we were looking at places that were really farther from Seattle than is ideal. Even places in Lynnwood were stretching our budget. We were in a conundrum, where it felt like our only option was having some nightmarish commute from Everett, or renting indefinitely.

When the median home price in Seattle was $449K, it was [$182K in Las Vegas.](https://www.zillow.com/las-vegas-nv/home-values/) So we bought a place out there, and rented it out.

Homes were so cheap, one of the problems we had was getting financing. Not because we couldn't qualify. But because *the loans were so small* the banks didn't want to do them. (I learned that banks basically won't do loans for a home if the balance is under $100K.)

I know that people think that a 15% year-over-year increase in home prices seems like a lot, but Seattle / Portland / San Francisco / Los Angeles are way in the back of the pack when it comes to this stuff.

For instance, [Vegas is up 30.5% in the last year.](https://www.zillow.com/las-vegas-nv/home-values/)

The way that you make money on real estate is really basic:

**Can you borrow the money at a lower rate than what the property is going up?** If yes, you make money.

For instance, in 2020 you could borrow at 3%. So if you invested a million in real estate in Vegas in 2021, you'd be up about $305K today, and you would have spent $30,000 to borrow the money, leaving you a profit of about $275K.

in 2006 you could borrow at 6%. So if you invested a million in real estate in 2006, *it was a wash.* Basically once you paid your property taxes and you paid for maintenance, [all your profits had disappeared.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS)

So if you're looking to buy affordable property, you might consider looking at areas that are already performing well. 

""Past performance is not indicative of future results."" But real estate trends tend to move slowly. One of the things that helps me sleep better at night is the realization that if you were looking at the right stats in 2005, you could have seen the 2007 Bubble coming and got out before it hit. (Hint: look at inventory stats.)

Also, the money tends to accumulate in a hurry. We went from $35K to invest on a $135K house to where we're at now, which is that we can afford to live almost anywhere, even on modest I.T. salaries. A few months ago we were considering a place for $4m. (We decided to pass on it and just bought another investment property.) In a nutshell, once you've got $1M under management, your investments are making you wealthier than your day job is. So it's not like you have to be the CEO of a tech company to accumulate millions; once you hit a certain level of wealth it tends to accumulate on it's own. If you put $35K into an Everett fixer-upper in 2012 [you'd have about half a million today.](https://www.zillow.com/everett-wa/home-values/) If you did the same trick every other year for ten years, you'd be a multi-millionaire.

Personally, I am a big fan of investing in the cities where Californians are flocking to. I think you could spend the rest of your life profiting from [the exodus from California.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/ti3em8/oc_the_exodus_from_california_from_20152019/) If you take the states from that infographic and you put their big cities in a spreadsheet, I guarantee you that everyone of them is going up double digits in price. During yesterday's discussion on the topic, a lot of people were saying that ""California isn't shrinking."" I think the thing that people don't realize about California, is that for every million people who LEAVE California there's a million who arrive from abroad. When I moved from the Seattle area to California, literally 75% of my neighbors were from China, Korea and India. First generation Americans, moving to California largely for tech jobs. This influx creates a never ending exodus OUT of California. I'm on an Internet forum for people who are leaving California, and nearly 100% of them are middle class people who have $500K-$1M in equity and are moving to lower COL areas. So you can tap that demographic until the end of time, if you're willing to be a landlord. Obviously, you won't be renting to the people *leaving* California, you'll be renting to the people in the cities where Californians are moving to. Basically the exodus of Californians is a boon for property owners in the cities where Californians are heading.

Please do your own research, but here's some of mine:

Bend Oregon has a median home price of $732K and has [gone up 32.4% in the last year.](https://www.zillow.com/bend-or/home-values/)

St George UT has a median home price of $535K and has [gone up 38.9% in the last year.](https://www.zillow.com/saint-george-ut/home-values/)

Spokane has a median home price of $400K and has [gone up 27.6% in the last year.](https://www.zillow.com/spokane-wa/home-values/)

Those are just three. YMMV, but to me, the investments that are reliably great are where Californians are headed. You could even make a solid argument that Seattle has benefited from decades of Californians bailing and moving here.

I know this post sounds like some kind of infomercial. I have nothing to sell. I am just a dude who used to make the Godawful commute to work and I reached a point where I was like *""there's gotta be a better way.""* I didn't even get into real estate out of any ""love"" for the industry, I was purely looking for a way for my wife and I to afford a house that was reasonably sized and not too far from work. We were totally priced out, so we invested elsewhere, then cashed out once we'd accumulated enough to get what we *really* wanted in the first place.

https://www.google.com/search?q=shellenberger+rogan

It's episode 1719 of the Rogan show. A few thoughts about the episode:

* To me, the thing that really hit home is how far the Overton Window has shifted. Shellenberger studied [""Peace and Global Studies""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shellenberger) in college, and has roots that are firmly Liberal, but he's getting cast out from the Democrat tent for trying to come up with solutions to the homeless problem. Shellenberger is solidly Liberal; it's disappointing to me that the only shows that have put him on are Conservative or right-leaning. Homelessness affects *everyone.*

* Shellenberger has invested a lot of time studying solutions that work, particularly in The Netherlands.

* He spends quite a bit of time talking about how Progressive activists are attacking Liberals who are trying to solve this problem. There's an interesting segue about how activists attacked Shellenberger, basically saying that even *observing* that homeless do drugs is ""causing violence to the homeless 'community.'""

* Some great discussion about how language is being used to change the narrative. About how other countries are quicker to recognize that many of these ""camps"" are not ""camps,"" they're organized groups of addicts doing drugs. For instance, Shellenberger points out that many of these camps attract people *who aren't even homeless.*

As with any podcast that's three hours long, the show can drag a bit, but there's enough gold to make if worthwhile to listen to the whole thing.

Facebook recently announced that they would allow hate speech against Russian people. Which is insane:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-facebook-instagram-temporarily-allow-calls-violence-against-russians-2022-03-10/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-facebook-instagram-temporarily-allow-calls-violence-against-russians-2022-03-10/)

Where are the protests? I've also seen complaints of hate speech/harassment in other establishments, people living here who have nothing to do with it. This is going in the direction of Japanese internment camps, though much worse because USA isn't even in this war; we are just observers. Instead of speeding more hate to the war we should reinforce the values of a strong/diverse community by being supportive to people who may be directly affected by this war. Even Russians many of whom don't support it. We need to be practicing the values we preach, which include de-escalation; not hate speech/threats.

For comic relief on this, watch this:

They is crazy on both spectrums between liberals and conservatives but what these people consider progressive is mind blowing. There are many things to discuss in regards to this. 

Cultural appropriation: When people lived in geographically different areas at one time and all races were separated they were taught and influenced by their own culture. They had to learn in somehow over hundreds of years of influence. I hate the term cultural appropriation because now we are a melting pot all cultures combining in different countries especially america. So if we are influenced and taught from other cultures why do we call it cultural appropriation? It should be cultural appreciation. To me what they deem racist is actually more racist like they don’t want other cultures to be influenced by others.

Black Lives Matter: of course they do. It seems to me racism is taught from an early age. Showing photos of black vs white drinking fountains. Why not teach about it in a different way? Maybe about how genetics and biological evolution work based off of geographical location. Why people have more melanin or less in their skin and other features. We’re still not teaching like we’re all the same but different based off of advantages these genetic differences had in our environments. Doing things like “black owned restaurants” is only separating people further and focusing on skin color.

Corona virus: yes I believe it’s real I had it myself. It’s not progression teaching people that wearing masks, hand sanitizer and isolation and what equate to health and safety. This is psychologically going to affect people for years to come. There was a time a the very beginning of industrialization when people were very unhealthy and had a hard time with any virus or bacteria. This was due to living and working conditions, their water supply and very poor diet. The book “dissolving illusions” by Suzanne Humphries is a good one to read regarding the history of disease and such. There’s been times in this industrialization that are health was certainly better because of a better work life balance and better food. Now we are living in poor environmental conditions, to focused on work, soil is nutrient depleted etc. just look at infertility rates and how many women are having problems with fertility. What our bodies are designed to do. 

There’s much more to touch on and many more things but it seems no matter what people think they’re doing to create change or control other people is only going to harm us in the long run. The government is the major influencer when it comes to all of these problems we’re having.

- Parking available (planning to have a car for commuting to work)

We got a quote today, and I expected the cost to be higher for an initial visit/clean up, but not $1,700 high. Our house sits on a lot just under 6,000sq ft so not huge. Front yard is tiny and mostly empty flower beds with some random shrubbery and a small Japanese maple, backyard is similar just a little bitter. Nothing super over grown, some of the bushes just need some trimming and shaping, and flower beds need cleaning up of pine cones/needles and some moss build up. We didn’t ask them to plant anything new or cut down any trees and did most of the heavy clean up as far as ripping out of overgrown stuff last summer ourselves. Planned on doing it ourselves this spring but have a baby on the way, so thought why not see what it would cost for someone to do the initial fall-to-spring clean up and we can maintain from there.

11/05/2021 I received an email notification about my rent increase over email, shortly after that I received it in writing over mail. There was NO amount of increase in neither of them, just a notice about the fact the rent will increase in May

03/01/2022 I received the amount of increase over email, haven't received it in writing yet. The offer was +20% rent increase, 12 months term

I contacted Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections and they pointed out the notice might be defective since it was sent a little later than 180 days prior. I received a very vague answer if the original notice should have information about the actual amount of increase. 

I contacted my landlord trying to negotiate the increase saying, that the original notice might be defective and the officials may request a rescission of the original notice. I offered to add +$100 to the rent instead of $400 for 12 months for officials not to resciss the original notice so the landlord would need to offer me the same terms of rent for another year without any increase.

The landlord agreed on my +$100 offer, but offered 6 months lease only without any room to negotiate further. I bloody need 12 months, I need to be on one place till the next year which means I would need to move out by the end of my term for the sake of not changing the adress till the next year. 

Question: 
Does is worth to contact Seattle Department of Construction again and ask them to contact my landlord for them to request a rescission of the original notice. Does the rescission will actually mean the landlord would have to offer me the same terms as it is now without increase? Have anyone had success in a similar situation?

Anyone who knows the market knows it's not friendly to most but definitely not to a first time homebuyer not even for a townhome which is so depressing (max budget is 800k). We met with our bank to understand the process and after going through the pre-approval process we were told that it would be a waste of our time because while there were lending options we didn't have extra cash to compete on top of what we saved for the down payment. I tried to do follow ups to simply understand the process better and don't get replies from the employee we worked with which was irritating. We decided we don't want to go to a different place and restart the process because while harsh they were likely right so figured I'd just ask here. 

One thing I am confused about is the appraisal process of a home specifically in our area now. Many people are going 100s of thousands over ask which seems so unreal to me and I am seeing reports that relators are listing houses at lower prices because the low inventory and attractive price are causing frenzies in an environment where inventory is low. So how soon does that affect the appraisal of a home? Does that parameter move the appraisal needle at a proportional rate to the percentage of homes going over ask or is it a metric that doesn't influence the homes value that much compared to others like condition or size?

Because we don't have hundreds of thousands extra over our down payment to pay over what the bank would lend us will all these sales begin to drive the homes value up so that gap starts to close a bit? This may be a moot point if people then just pay 100s over the new price but I guess I am getting tired of seeing 700k homes because my first thought is ""I'm sure that will sell for 900k or more in 1 day 😑"" and that usually happens.",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,263353,public,confidence,self,Question about the Seattle real estate market,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/tbanm1/question_about_the_seattle_real_estate_market/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My left tire was on the inside edge of the left mark. Pretty decent park job considering guy to my right was in my spot.

Anyway, I come back and new cars are in the spots on either side and someone had put a little 3 x 2 printed sheet under my rear wiper that says “Park Between the Lines” 

I was between the lines.

Now some people are just Karens so, whatever, but here’s what gets me: this little sheet of paper had obviously been torn out of a larger stapled booklet of these things. 

That means one of you douchebags, in between arguing against body cameras on Twitter and virtue signaling at your favorite encampment (not really we know you work from home and spend all day on the other sub), actually bought a booklet of these things because you have found so many opportunities to give them out.  Anonymously, of course. And usually undeservedly.

Anyone else get it? Copied the body of the email below: 

Dear SPS Families and Staff,  

Seattle Public Schools will lift its current mask requirements beginning Monday, March 14.  

In alignment with Gov. Jay Inslee’s updated health guidance, the Washington State Department of Health, and Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County, masks will become optional both indoors and outdoors at SPS buildings and on school buses (yellow buses). Please note: masks will continue to be required for students who ride King County Metro public transit. 

Until March 14, current masking protocols will remain in place. Masks will continue to be required for all students, staff, and visitors on all SPS campuses and school buses through March 13. 

We are pleased that COVID-19 cases continue to fall in SPS schools and King County. However, there may be times when we will need to bring back effective mitigations if there is an increase in community, classroom, or school-wide transmission. SPS will continue to monitor COVID-19 rates in our schools. [Updates can be found on our COVID-19 dashboard.](http://track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/s3LoUb8fo1uTkbAdgvE-Ng~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRkCjUsP0Q8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VhdHRsZXNjaG9vbHMub3JnL3Jlc291cmNlcy9jb3ZpZC0xOS1kYXNoYm9hcmQvVwdzY2hvb2xtQgpiJ6wBKWKVSt8JUhFnYnJvd241QGdtYWlsLmNvbVgEAAAAAQ~~) 

The health and safety of our students, staff, and communities remains a top priority for SPS. While masks will be optional, additional layers of mitigation remain in place including:  

* Vaccine and booster access at SPS clinics 
* Protected health care rooms 
* COVID-19 testing opportunities 
* Masks for students and staff, who want to continue masking 
* Physical distancing to the greatest extent possible 
* Increased air ventilation (HVAC) and air quality testing 

As always, frequent handwashing and staying home when you are sick are still strongly recommended.  

We understand that there are different beliefs, opinions, reasons, and comfort levels around masking, yet it is important to be patient and respect the personal choices of others.  

Some families may have vulnerable household members or have younger siblings who are not yet eligible for vaccination. We will continue to foster a climate of empathy and equity. Our students and school community have been through a challenging – and in some ways traumatic – two years, yet our outlook is hopeful. We are grateful that brighter and healthier days are ahead of us.

Minutes later, SPD officers are seen asking guards to move back as they engage the suspect. The shooter initially complies with demands to drop the weapon and get on the ground. However, he appears to get up while raising his weapon toward the responding officers. Officers can be heard telling the man: ""Don't do it."" Shots ring out.

Five officers shot at the suspect, they include:  Zachary Backman (hired in 2018), Elijah Banks (hired in 2019), Stephen Englund (hired in 2019), Danielle Fine (hired in 2010), and  Nicholas Soldati (hired in 2018). The officers rendered aid, but the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene.

# What problem are we solving?

Traditional deployment and operation of enterprise (business) workloads are time-consuming and manual processes. It's inefficient and often plagued with errors. These errors can lead to troubleshooting which delays the workload's availability. They might also expose security vulnerabilities that can put the enterprise (business) at risk.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

These are the most frequently asked migration questions:

**Is there a maximum number of users I can migrate?**

In most cases, the data migration service works best when migrating 100 users or less during a single migration. You can migrate more users, but you might see a drop in performance.

For other migration options, please visit Migrate365.

**Can I migrate from multiple sources to one user account?**

No. The data migration service is designed to allow only one migration at a time to a specified user. We do not recommend having multiple concurrent API requests migrating data into a single user account.

**How long will a migration take?**

The duration of migration depends on numerous factors, such as:

* Number of Users
* Migration Start Date you select, the longer the period, the longer it takes
* Number and Size of items being migrated

# Final Thoughts

We're at a time with the enormous social and economic disruption that is accelerated by technological breakthroughs. The combination of cloud computing, Big Data, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), mixed reality, robotics, and sensors are impacting socio-economic change. It's an exciting time to learn to unlearn.

Consumer applications like Microsoft 365, LinkedIn, Lyft, DoorDash, and Facebook all live in the cloud. With the rise of cyberattacks, the cloud is much more desirable than ever. So many people around the world today depend on mobile and cloud technologies without knowing it.

Cloud computing makes it possible to analyze vast quantities of data to produce specific insights and intelligence, converting guesswork and speculation into predictive power. It has standardized and aggregated computing resources and automated maintenance tasks once done manually. It has allowed for elastic scaling up or down, self-service, pay-as-you-go basis. Migrate365 is excited to empower our customers with an easy cloud automated solution.

To give an example of vagueness - they prohibited police from using “physical force’ during Terry Stops or any sort of mental health detention - many agencies conservatively interpreted that to include handcuffing or ANY touching - thus even when MHP’s/DCR’s had warrants to take incredibly dangerous (to self and:Or others) people in mental crisis into protective custody - the warrants went unserved .

Anyway ...

As I predicted the legislature did a COMPLETE 180

Today -  2 of these damaging “police reform ‘ laws were reversed on EMERGENCY basis (unanimous or all but 1 or 2 votes ) and thus are now law - the ban on less lethal shotguns etc is now overturned 


AND the ban on ‘physical force ‘ for ITA/mental crisis invol’s

Three more are either on the governor desk (Veto proof approval) or enroute to include renewed ability to do vehicle pursuits, make Terry stops etc 

In 35 yrs working with cops, and DCR’s and studying case law in dozens of states as a firearms/unarmed combat instructor etc I have NEVER seen any legislature ever do a complete reversal like this 

Any agency can put far harsher restrictions on their cops than state law requires (like SPD limiting vehicle pursuit to BARK felonies for years ) but at least STATE LAW has gone back to a proper balancing of state authority/victim rights/defendant rights 

Again - I have never seen a more radical reversal of law in any state (or the federal level ) in 4 decades

I want to take action.  Personally, we are able to move to a different school district. We struggle with this because we like living in the city but I'm very concerned that the flaws in their decision making processes will continue to manifest themselves in the next few years, and I think our (collective) children's education will suffer as a result.

TLDR: Tub won’t drain, landlord can’t figure out what’s wrong and I have no access to a shower. 


Hello, I live in an old house that’s divided into duplexes. (This came up in my last post so I’m just going to say it now, we know this old historic house that we love and cherish is OLD. For that reason we take extra considerations with the plumbing and always have.) My tub stopped draining this past Saturday.

Here’s a brief summary of events:

Saturday: Tub stopped draining, property management sent maintenance guy. Guy couldn’t drain tub left some industrial strengths draino. We poured the draino as instructed and it did not work.

Sunday: no one was sent.

Monday: property management tells us to expect a plumber between 4-8. My partner took time off of work to come home and make sure he could let the plumber in and wrangle my dogs (who are nice but obviously nervous about strangers in coming in the house). 
Plumber didn’t show up until 10 pm. Couldn’t drain it and told us they would have to send someone with a camera out. He left around 11pm which left us no time to try to come up with a plan.

Today: I had to call out of work to be available to let the guy in and wrangle my dogs while they try to unclog the tub. Said they couldn’t and another guy with a fucking microscopic camera would need to come. They gave me 3 different estimated arrival times since 7am. They just left now after being here for an hour. 
They said there’s probably a busted line and when I asked how soon it could be fixed they said “idk, we’ll have to talk to your property manager.” 
Edit: third “microscopic” camera guy has not come this was just what the “normal” sized camera guys told me was the next step. 

They leave and I tried calling my property manager TWICE. No answer. I had emailed him about this and I got no answer. We’ve been talking to the property management maintenance team this entire time. 

I am freaking out and stressed because this is a huge inconvenience. We only have ONE bathroom. I can’t work out and TMI (really sorry) but I’m menstruating and it’s so uncomfortable to not be able to have some basic fucking hygiene. This is day 4 and we are going on day five. My partner and I work 9-5 jobs and as lame as this sounds we don’t really have any close friends or family nearby that we can ask to use their shower.

HERES THE UPDATE:
They sent out a plumber for Beacons yesterday guy couldn’t fix it, said they need to figure out where the line is and see what the actual issue at hand is. The guy apparently broke two augers(?) trying to find a clog. They either need to find it externally or take out the tub. 
The building management maintenance people came TODAY and dug on the side of the house themselves. They did not find what they were looking for. 
They had us use a shop vac LAST NIGHT to get water out of the tub so we could take a goddamn shower. The shop vac cap fell into the toilet as we were trying to vacuum out the water (please save the “are you an idiot” comments, I’m really just trying to navigate this miserable situation.) and it rendered the toilet complete unusable so we now had a whole UNUSABLE bathroom situation. We had to find a hotel to stay at at midnight last night. Now they are telling us another plumber is coming out tomorrow and they are going to help find the line or whatever the fuck so going on day 6. Don’t have a working shower, I’m currently spending a second night at a hotel. Toilet is fixed, shower is now.


My question is: is the landlord/property management responsible for finding accommodations? We called out renters insurance and they basically said they need a formal cause to be able to open a case and basically they don’t cover anything caused by wear and tear (don’t know how they define that) and nothing that was our fault. 
What are our rights in this situation?
Anyone been in a similar situation? 

Building management has not offered any rental pro-rating or offered any accommodations. All the building manager said is they are working on it and they will let us off our lease and return or deposit if it something they have to gut the bathroom over.",True,False,False,SeattleWA,t5_2vbli,261952,public,confidence,self,How long can landlords in Seattle take to fix a serious plumbing issue?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/t5i9ss/how_long_can_landlords_in_seattle_take_to_fix_a/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may be a long shot. I've paid all through the moratorium even when I could have played victim. I'll give a brief rundown of my history and willing to expand in DMs if someone is interested in giving me the time of day.

Im 28. In the 2010s I was homeless for several years. Again, it's too long of a story to type it all here but obviously I'm willing to give you full insight to my situation. It wasn't always bad for me. I used to own my own business, but I let obstacles destroy my life for awhile. Excluding responsible drinking (which ive been actively cutting out), I have been sober and clean since October 2018. Haven't even slipped up even once on the drugs. 

I moved to Seattle in 2019 from down south. It was a risky move, but I did it. I came here with absolutely nothing but a name. I did what I had to do, grinded at jobs, bussed 3 hours+ a day getting back and forth to work, got my own car, finally got myself housed.

I have been living in the complex I'm in for a little over 2 years now. While a lot of other people wasted time accruing backrent debt, I didn't let covid or any of that shit stop me or change my dedication to get my life back. I'm current.

My tub stopped draining this past Saturday.

Here’s a brief summary of events:

Saturday: Tun stopped draining, property management sent maintenance guy. Guy couldn’t drain tub left some industrial strengths draino. We poured the draino as instructed and it did not work.

Sunday: no one was sent.

Monday: property management tells us to expect a plumber between 4-8. My partner took time off of work to come home and make sure he could let the plumber in and wrangle my dogs (who are nice but obviously nervous about strangers in coming in the house). 
Plumber didn’t show up until 10 pm. Couldn’t drain it and told us they would have to send someone with a camera out. He left around 11pm which left us no time to try to come up with a plan.

Today: I had to call out of work to be available to let the guy in and wrangle my dogs while they try to unclog the tub. Said they couldn’t and another guy with a fucking microscopic camera would need to come. They gave me 3 different estimated arrival times since 7am. They just left now after being here for an hour. 
They said there’s probably a busted line and when I asked how soon it could be fixed they said “idk, we’ll have to talk to your property manager.” 

They leave and I tried calling my property manager TWICE. No answer. I had emailed him about this and I got no answer. We’ve been talking to the property management maintenance team this entire time. 

I am freaking out and stressed because this is a huge inconvenience. We only have ONE bathroom. I can’t work out and TMI (really sorry) but I’m menstruating and it’s so uncomfortable to not be able to have some basic fucking hygiene. This is day 4 and we are going on day five. My partner and I work 9-5 jobs and as lame as this sounds we don’t really have any close friends or family nearby that we can ask to use their shower.

I'm looking to connect with anyone in Seattle or WA state who has faced similar systemic disability discrimination and/or others willing to take action to address systemic disability discrimination in WA. 

Entities:

1. DSHS
2. Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH)
3. Caregiver agencies
4. Mental health agencies
5. Housing Authority
6. Health Care providers
7. Managed Care Organization (Medicaid providers)

I just spent the last month working on a response to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services Office of Civil Rights (HHS OCR) regarding disability discrimination by WA state Department of Social &amp; Health Services (DSHS) employees and contractors (11 entities in total).   

In January, I submitted a response to WA State Human Rights Commission (WSHRC) regarding disability discrimination at the Office of Administrative Hearings.  

It's almost the same thing at each entity. I request reasonable accommodations. The state employees/contractors don't follow the law.  In many cases, I file a civil rights grievance to the entity and they don't actually investigate or resolve the grievance like they are required to by law.  

I then file with  WSHRC and/or HHS OCR and/or Department of Justice Civil Rights Division (DOJ CRD, which handles ADA violations) and it takes them  (8-13+) months to even start an investigation.  More than a year after reporting some of these entities I'm still not to the end of the process with any of these investigators.
