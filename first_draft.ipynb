      "Seattle City Council Newsletters!! Reddit: Hey everyone! I just wanted to introduce myself again. My name is George, and I am a rising junior at Stanford interested in civic engagement and politics. I started working on a project with other students that’s been totally awesome and cool. Basically, we’ve made a newsletter that summarizes the info from Seattle City Council meetings in an accessible and easy way. I have put an example from this week below, though the real thing has a bit more formatting that doesn't translate into Reddit.

      "SPD should be barred from any display of Thin Blue Line symbols and SPOG should be abolished The Myth of the Lynchpin Officer Died in Uvalde With those dear children, the myth of the lynchpin officer died in Uvalde. By the doctrine of The Thin Blue Line, police require broad discretion on use-of-force decisions. This is because officers hold the line between order and chaos. Improperly restrained and police may fail – in which case something terrible could happen. lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll A grand jury has been assembled in Denver after police shot six innocent bystanders in a failed attempt to kill a man who’d surrendered. lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll The Thin Blue Line has come to represent a distinct ideology widely adopted by police throughout the US. This is clearly an extremist ideology, though its simple propositions guide the organization, training and professional conduct of law enforcement organizations nationwide. This is a problem that requires immediate attention and forceful action. Because police officers employed to protect and serve, it turns out, conduct themselves quite differently than officers employed as lynchpins against \"chaos.\" The defund slogan got as far as it did, let’s be honest, because it doesn’t appear that our standing army of lynchpin officers is willing to stand under a banner of service through sacrifice – at least not by any standard view of what sacrifice might entail. We expect police to accept risk on our behalf, that’s the job, I think we all agree on that at face value. Yet, through aggressive union representation and by the blessing of an apparently drunken judiciary, police have foisted the dangers of policing onto the public to the point that the most obvious sacrifice involved with the vocation is carrying the emotional costs of committing horrific acts of violence. Prolific cop trainer, “Killology” author and blue line devotee Dave Grossman speaks to this directly. The following quotes Grossman in a video titled, “The Police Trainer Who Teaches Cops to Kill | The New Yorker,” which is available on youtube. “Are you emotionally, spiritually, psychologically prepared to snuff out a human life in defense of innocent lives? If you can’t make that decision, you need to find another job….Do you understand you could be sued for not shooting? Stand there and do nothing while people are murdered, what do they call that? Cowardice, malfeasance, dereliction of duty….Don’t be afraid to get sued, everybody gets sued, just a chance for overtime. Be afraid of being sued successfully.” I didn’t have to go cherry picking for that quote or misrepresent the context to cast a shadow over policing – it was plainly said. The blue line ideology is literally reducible to “shoot first ask questions later” without a hint of dishonesty or bad faith. And the further you dig into the source of that quote or the culture he’s informed, the more obvious it becomes that the decision to shoot 6 innocent bystanders in Denver was made in a classroom. In this classroom, pupils were taught to recognize split second decision making as cause to shoot - which is far different than training to make the right split second decision and then fostering a culture that enforces expectations of accuracy. Nonetheless, it will likely be decried as cherry picking to suggest that the argument for restricting police use of force is six times stronger than arguments in favor of officer discretion, given what happened in Denver. But that strength differential is not for the simple fact that Denver police shot six innocent people in a failed attempt to kill a man who’d surrendered. No, it’s because police authorities in Denver, like everywhere else in this nation, won’t straightaway condemn such acts or the mindset and training that delivered such results – because they’re blue line extremists willing to trade the well being of 6 innocent bystanders for phantoms of faith. A simple value proposition The blue line proposes to maximize public safety through the surgical application of necessary violence. A police force that worships of violence of action is a bargain for public safety, the faith maintains, so beneficial that its value is not diminished by distasteful appearances. Like when police training materials in Louisiana were found to quote Hitler more than any other source, for instance. Because public safety is maximized when police are endowed with broad discretion on use-of-force decisions – as the many units of “chaos” held back by police violence effectively offsets the public safety costs of six innocent bystanders being shot, for example. It’s our fault, I suppose, for not demanding that these phantom public safety gains be demonstrated more clearly. Because, clearly, a thousand people shot dead by police each year nationwide is too high a bar. And that’s not to mention all those unnecessarily brutalized, harassed or disrespected in nonlethal police encounters. Given that policing isn’t, in fact, particularly dangerous, it seems wise to ask: for whom is blue line policing a bargain? A popular counterpoint to this anti-police rhetoric is that only a small percentage of police encounters become violent. Therefore, it’s held, claims of rampant police violence are unfounded. But if this is true then shouldn’t we also recognize that, by the numbers, which are overwhelmingly clear, policing causes far more physical harm to innocent citizens than to police officers themselves, and that the greatest threat to officer safety is their culture of impunity? And that, therefore, the flagship content of blue line ideology is propagandist fiction? I mean, the majority of police deaths are traffic related, which is probably not unrelated to the fact that so many police refuse to buckle up – though they’ll write you a ticket for doing the same. Similarly, the 55% spike in police deaths from 2020 to 2021 is attributable to COVID related deaths, which is probably not unrelated to the fact that so many police refused to wear masks – even when mandated by laws they enforced against others. It shouldn’t be controversial to recognize that, by the numbers, the value propositions of the blue line simply do not add up. A derelict judiciary But what about the fact that so many police killings, a clear majority, are ruled “justified?” That kind of shoots a hole in the reasoning above, doesn’t it? No – twist – actually, it doesn’t. Instead, it’s simply a testament to how extreme policing has been allowed to become. This is thanks to the persistent and growing dereliction of our judiciary. Blue line extremism grew into what it is today in the shadow of a series of absurd legal delusions. Without such cover, the blue line would have surely been cleansed by the light of day. Qualified immunity The “court created doctrine” of qualified immunity is likely the most notorious legal delusion of them all. This doctrine holds that police are immune from civil liability except where it can be shown that an officer has violated an individual’s “clearly established rights.” While lay people such as myself widely regard our first and fourth amendment rights as pretty fucking clearly established, that is not how this works. The test for whether or not an officer has violated clearly established rights comes down to whether or not the officer “reasonably” knew their actions would violate an individual’s rights. In Texas in 2020, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it wasn’t reasonable to expect a corrections officer to understand that an unprovoked pepper spray attack against an inmate would violate his rights, because the case cited by the plaintiff to demonstrate a clearly established right concerned prison guards beating and tasing inmates – not pepper spraying them. In essence, qualified immunity invokes the irrelevant to practically guarantee officers freedom from civil liability and it turns the concept of reasonableness into a brazen display of unlikely ignorance. And better still, since it was ruled that unprovoked pepper spray attacks against inmates warrant qualified immunity, the right to be free from such attacks by demented prison guards has become clearly unestablished. GrahamVConnor - 1989 A similar perversion of reasonableness is found in the 1989 supreme court ruling GrahamVConnor. The court confirmed in Graham that excessive force claims against police should be evaluated with respect to the “objective reasonableness” standard of the 4th Amendment. This test considers the severity of the suspect’s alleged crime, the threat level posed by the suspect and whether or not the suspect is resisting or evading. But, and here’s the kicker, those factors must be considered with respect for the fact that officers may be compelled to engage in split second decision making and “from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20 20 vision of hindsight.\" So, in practice, the “objective” reasonableness test dictated in Graham boils down to asking officers accused of excessive force whether or not they’re guilty. Because what cop would testify to perceptions that would cast their use of force in an “unreasonable” light? The result of this standard is that trigger-happy rambo cops have become the template for what passes as a “reasonable officer.” A special bill of rights and police unions Finally, we have the “Officer’s Bill of Rights” and the contractual legal favors achieved by police union negotiations. These vary from state to state and from one police department to the next but in either case they often afford police due process rights beyond those available to ordinary citizens accused of crimes. Police unions argue that these are necessary to protect police from overzealous prosecutors and internal affairs. But it’s far easier to find hundreds of examples of these protecting police from warranted accountability – see Freddy Gray, for example – than it is to find even a single case of a police officer being victimized by a bad faith prosecution. Police are rarely charged, much less prosecuted, for abuses that are clearly unreasonable and unjustified by any standard definition of those terms. Furthermore, special favors written into the law strike against the legitimacy of our entire legal system, given that legal authority in the US uniquely depends on the rule of law, which basically holds that the law should be enforced equally against all, according to the internet. The Thin Blue Line is an extremist totem that should be abolished without a second thought US police are now firmly established at the intersection of Derelict Judiciary and Blue Line Extremism, which I hope I’ve shown is a real and distinct ideological force inside our police departments. At this place in policing, officers can proudly provide perimeter security for a terrorist as he murders children, while beating up any parent who tries to intervene, or they can bravely unleash a hail of gunfire into a crowd on a Sunday night. There appears to be no limit to this absurdity, really, as the aforementioned examples were not enough to compel forceful change. The faith maintains against distasteful appearances. And the police stand ready to beat back any forceful objection. We marched for change in 2020 and the police beat us then. We would have held them accountable for that but in Seattle they covered their badge numbers with a blue line. The chief, a snake, assured us that this had nothing to do with individual officers avoiding accountability for the skulls they cracked during Seattle’s infamous Summer of Love and everything to do with honoring fallen officers. Though apostates contend that, with that blue line over their badge, Seattle police shamelessly exploited the death of officers unaffiliated with the department to evade accountability while it simply abused the community – for no other obvious reason than to retain its impunity. Because police in Seattle didn’t beat up too many rioters, as any FOX News report from that time will confirm, but they did consistently target press, protest medics and constitutionally protected protesters. So as the mythical lynchpin carries on past Uvalde like some kind of headless chicken, I hope we can finally recognize the ability to reinforce as the true foundation of robust public safety. We don’t need rambo cops if we have officers who view sacrifice as more of a willingness to face mortal danger, and risk dying, than a capacity for violence, and risk killing unnecessarily. With brave cops, restrained from preemptive violence and backed by sophisticated reinforcement capabilities – which, as it happens, we already have – there’s no threat we cannot overcome. There’s just one component missing...but SPOG stands in our way.\n",

      "I sent my Seattle School Board director an email about the strike and negotiations and this morning she called and we talked for an hour! Here are my notes. Last night I sent an email to my Seattle School Board Director Chandra Hampson - SPS district 3 via her seattleschools.com email address, sharing my thoughts about the strike and union demands, and asking that the board won't file an injunction against the striking teachers. I was surprised this morning when Chandra called me directly and offered to discuss all my concerns. What an amazing opportunity! Luckily I was at my desk and ready to take notes. She has time for calling one constituent each day, and I was fortunate enough to be free at the time when she did call, and had already written out a lot of questions and thoughts because of the ongoing strike. We had an hour-long discussion and I asked about the strike, the teacher demands, the comprehensive school board plan details listed on the district website, etc. Hampson was super focused to get me answers and I'm thankful for her time. Below are my notes from the conversation, and I tried to leave out my own commentary or editorializing and focus on her responses until the very end. Hampson has 3 kids in the Seattle public schools, 2 of them have 504s in place, and they went to Sandpoint Elementary. As a parent she is also dealing with her kids being out of school due to the negotiations and strike. She has been in the role of teacher, parent, and now elected to the Seattle School Board. Hampson wanted to clarify a couple things about roles and responsibilities of the different groups involved. As a parent I was also quite confused about what the focus and role are of the School Board and the district, compared to the teacher's union, and how each side is involved in the ongoing contract negotiations. Before diving in - Hampson shared the Lighthouse study on school boards, results of which are driving how school boards are being structured around the country. It's the largest study on school board performance and is guiding our current board's methods for their own structures and policies: A school board director job is entirely about governance, not customer support, meaning: they are responsible with setting the direction of the schooling, curriculum decisions, guidance towards classroom and school best practices, and ensuring that schools have resources available to execute on planned changes. In the context of the inclusivity model more on that later Hampson clarified the School Board's job is to provide the direction and the goals for the inclusion, clarify what is required at federal, state levels and what is not permitted by law. The director position is not like other elected officials because the school board is elected to represent the students first and foremost, and the community in which they live. It is \"the worst elected job\" because of how thankless their efforts are but also how impactful the decisions become. Hampson was very clear that the board \"doesn't represent teachers or parents, but instead represents the entire community when making decisions\". They have to think of what's best for the entire community in Seattle, not one specific interest group or demographic. Because the directors are so focused on governance they do not have time for \"customer support\". They do often help connect parents with resources, or help solve problems at specific schools in their coverage. They're full-time focus, however, is governance and decision making. Some tactical changes are being made to address the problems around customer service. Right now the board has hired a consultancy to perform a full communications audit of the district to try and figure out where and how they can improve communications internal and external, and it's up to the superintendent to get the district staff to provide all the data and information. Additionally, the board is aware that they need to create a high-value customer service department to handle the myriad problems parents face when trying to navigate district policies and processes. The community needs to understand that the only non-district entity involved is the SEA teachers union - by definition the union is created to advocate for teachers and teacher negotiation, but the district and board are created to support the students and drive student success. This may seem like semantics, but it's a very clear distinction that the SEA union is an external entity that is hired to do a job, much like an attorney is when representing clients. The union will use every tactic to get what they need for their members because that is their primary purpose for which they are hired, even if it isn't best for the students. They will use spin and stalling tactics, and others to get the agreed-upon list of demands. The union is looking at teacher advocacy, not student success. The difference can seem subtle at first glance. Now to a primary sticking point of the ongoing strike and negotiations: data and real-world experiences in other districts and states show that an inclusion model will get us out of being stuck with the problems the schools face when dumping money and resources into SEL multilingual and special ed, but not getting results or pushing the needle. Last year, the existing model used in Seattle schools poured $120M in addition to all the state funding, but the results were abysmal. Everyone, across the board, including teachers, staff, admins all believe that the goals and results of a properly-executed inclusivity program at the district level is not only achievable, but is the right path to follow. It's clear that the 1:1 model of assignment for SEL does not produce the desired or federally mandated results, and it just segregates students, often along demographic lines that are historically underperforming. The board believes that if we don't start with the inclusion mechanisms this year we may never catch up to the goals set by law. In response to the need for the inclusivity model the SEA teachers union created a task force to come up with a plan on how to rollout and execute in the schools, and to determine which resource would be needed. The board is 100% behind the task force's plan toward inclusion, and also getting the staff the resources they need to implement it. To support the plan the School Board determined that no changes to staffing ratios will happen in the 2022 23 school year, and instead the year should be used for onboarding teachers and admins, support training, and build out curricular resources for inclusion. For this first year the School Board is asking for a 1-year contract. The plan will take 5-10 years to unwind and rebuild for full implementation, and it's clear that things will be more expensive at first before efficiencies materialize to decrease cost over a few years, and to achieve all the expected student results. The board is trying to update and modernize the practices of the district because it's clear that many students are not getting the experience and opportunities they need. I asked Hampson what the role of a director is in the current strike. She believes that the board and district didn't do enough to inform teachers and parents during the pandemic that this large uplift is coming. For that reason, and others, there is a real trust gap, and also a belief gap - people don't believe that the school board is reformed in their direction and their commitment to the schools and teachers. The school board is primarily responsible for the belief gap. The last superintendent put out communications that weren't true, but the new board and district staff are committed to be ing extremely fact-based. The superintendent has been directed to focus solely on student issues. As a director, Hampson is staying focused on the specific goals set for the district - things that must be done or are not allowed. The board is keeping students at the center of their focus. Sometimes that means asking tough questions like \"can we afford this?\" Right now the SEA union is asking for $500M, but the planned investment in school resources is already greater than what we currently spend. No one is saying \"screw the inclusion thing\" and everyone agrees with the goals, however there is disagreement on how to get there. The current board cannot agree to things that will result in a deficit for the next board. Okay, so what's the plan to get teachers and parents onboarded? Hampson has many points on what the board is doing to get us from here to there. First is addressing the big trust gap with the community. The first year of implementation is meant to be an onboarding time to work on aligning everyone on the process and goals, hence the board asking for a 1-year contract. The district will add additional staff, and provide training opportunities for teachers, admins, and staff, on how to handle the transition to the inclusivity model. Not every classroom will become an inclusion classroom. The board is also reminding everyone that change is hard, especially transitioning from Seattle \"talking progressively\" about education and inclusivity to switching into execution mode and making actual changes that implement the goals. Many other tactical changes are happening. We have a brand new superintendent that is an expert in governance. The superintendent job is not like school-administration, but rather has to be someone who is an expert in governance; this encompasses an entirely different skill set than a former principle or school administrator. This is the first time that a superintendent is hired for that particular skill set, and we haven't yet had the time to see what exactly that means at the scale of SPS because of his short tenure thus far. The board is also asking the state and colleges to mandate teacher and administrator inclusivity and special ed training for all teachers graduating to work in our districts. It's not currently required and has created a huge deficit in teacher abilities in working with inclusion classrooms. The district is also buying curriculum for the first time. What that means is teachers will have curriculum that is uniform across the district, pre-made for them to use, and they will be able to train on the curriculum to avoid surprises or having to fall back to previous year's plans. The curricular support is aimed to reduce teacher burden so they can focus on classroom time more, and student interaction and not the overhead of building out curriculum. Individual plans do not scale to a system as large as SPS, and having uniformity makes for easier teacher onboarding and long-term success. My parting thoughts: I'm really thankful that I had the chance for a real discussion with a board member. It's not often that we can hear directly from decision makers and get responses to our questions without a news source or press release as an intermediary. It gives me validation that there are real people doing the hard work in those jobs. As a parent, Hampson knows what it's like working with the district, and going through the 504 and IEP process with her own children, and she knows the pains we feel watching these bureaucratic processes take place. Our feelings as parents and community members right now are very real, and the frustration is felt from all sides. I got the impression that Hampson and the school board are genuinely invested in the success and future of Seattle schools, students, and the community. I hope that we can all come together and collaborate for the sake of our students and for Seattle. The board's comprehensive plan is available on the schools website along with the current negotiation details. Here are some other resources that Hampson shared for reading on inclusion and school board data: The Lighthouse study article: Summary blog post of what is at stake in the current negotiation: \n",

      "Ren Faire Trip Report- Aug 14 Thought I would post a little about our experience at the Ren Faire this past Sunday the 14th! A little about our party, 3 adults and a 4 year old, none of us had ever been to a Ren Faire. Like a lot of people I’m sure, we woke up Sunday morning to u OK-Worth-9525 ‘s post about avoiding the Ren Faire. I read through all the reddit comments and the Google reviews and decided on some changes. One, packed more water than previously planned. Two, I packed a great load of snacks for the four year old and finally, three, we were leaving extra early. Packing List: Water, six bottles and a large yeti Sunscreen!!!!! Hats for everyone Snacks for the four year old Walking sneakers Umbrellas not aesthetic, but great for shade Cash iPad We arrived in Bonney Lake at 915 and parking was well directed and unremarkable, we were out of the car by 920. There were portapotties in the lot, so we made use and then wandered up to the gate. It was a bit chaotic but there was a man yelling directions so we paused to hear them. There was only one line- everyone had to go up to the cashiers to either purchase tickets or have prepurchased tickets validated and receive a stamp. The line moved fast once they opened around 945 and we were in by 10:10. Maps, menus, and the event schedule were posted by QR code all over the place, and each venue had its schedule posted out front, BUT the data that day was not working at all. We could SMS text or call, but data was not happening, which was annoying but not the event’s fault. We had made a must-see list Saturday night off the website and one of our group had the foresight to screenshot the map so we were able to navigate fine before we got our bearings. Some of the things we saw were in the same venue, others were elsewhere, so a lot of our vendor shopping happened as we moved between venues. 1015 We stopped by the Sweden tent to put in our RSVP for the Princess Tea. Ages 12 and under We overheard one of the staff comment that they were already 11 15 for spots, so we were glad we went there first! 1030 Raptor Events- This was educational and well presented! Love a birb. 1100 First Joust- Fun!!! The first joust of the day was all tests of skill. Each section cheered for a different knight and the section leaders were great. Four thought it was boring ?! I know, so we split from the others before the end for her to have her face painted. She really really liked this. It was totally smeared off by the end of the day, but her joy made it worth the 25$. 1200 Lunch- It was SUPER busy in the lunch area, this was kind of where the umbrella came in most handy to create portable shade while you’re standing waiting. Seating was tough to find- there was a LOT but table turnover wasn’t really happening, so we sat on the ground in the shade. Vegetarian options were a bit thin and almost all the food was hot which was rough. Expensive too but of course that’s no surprise for faire food. Four ordered a plain hamburger and ate only the top bun and the fries. The King of Spain came and performed quite a funny burlesque show for the eating crowd. 100 Cydshow Cy the Sword Swallower- This was by far the most anticipated thing for Four, and she loved it. It’s not for the squeamish like myself; one our group members split to peruse the vendors. 130 Mermaid and Fairy Glen- Four was absolutely entranced by the mermaid and had a lot of fun interacting with the fairies. She really enjoyed the bubbles too. There was a colouring space but every single sheet was completely coloured, which was a bummer. 200 Princess Tea- Back at the Sweden tent we adults lounged around in the shade while the 15 kids sat round a table for tea, lemonade, and cupcakes. Each kid got a gold paper crown and a little pinned badge with a unicorn. Princess Cecilia served the drinks while her sister told the table a story about her unicorn. She was really lovely, clearly had a lot of experience with kids. Once the meal was finished everyone got to go and pet the bunnies and feed the miniature ponies. 300 Storytime with the Wytchwood Players- this was my favourite thing!!! The lady told a wide variety of stories, her voice carried magnificently and she was really engaging. She also introduced a \\~10 year old girl and explained she’s still learning and would be telling us the story of how Thor got his hammer. All the adults paid rapt attention, she was soooo nervous it was super sweet. 330 IPad time- Four was flagging hard at this point and becoming quite wiggly. We were staying in the nice cool tent for the puppet show at 400, so I whipped out the iPad and loaded up a movie. We attracted two more kids to the ipad, which gave all us parents a chance to rest and chill. Our other two adults ventured into the afternoon heat to bring back snow cones and a strawberry lemonade, both of which received huge thumbs up from Four. 400 Puppet Show- This was fun and very British, which was enjoyed by all. 445 Sirena- We split the group for the other two adults to go see the final joust at 500 since Four didn’t enjoy the morning joust. Four wanted to hear music so we walked over to the village square to see Sirena. I thought these ladies were awesome, I loved their coordinated dancing and singing and drumming and the vibe was ethereal and spooky. Four did not love it, so we left to walk over to the jousting area to see if we could meet up with the others. 500 Final Joust- We were late to the joust and it was the last of the day, so it was a solid wall of people all the way around the ring. Four and I found a spot in the shade to wait until it was over. The other adults report that they sat front row on the ground and had a great view in the shade. This joust actually involved the competitors riding at each other! The cheering was exciting and I could sort of see from my spot. The event ended about 530 and it seemed like most folks headed for the gates 545 Dinner?- I walked over alone to see about scrounging up dinner and bringing it back to the group. This was Sunday and obviously almost closing time, a LOT of places were out of food, particularly anything vegetarian. Returned empty handed. 600 Equestrian Chaos- Ladies on horseback doing trick archery shots. The other two liked this, I kind of thought it was just OK. Four had absolutely had it and spent the entire time lying on the bleachers flopping around. She got to pet one of the horses at the end which perked her up. 645 Headed Home- Carried Four back to the car and we all used the toilet a final time. It took us sub 10 minutes to get out, totally unremarkable. Stuff for Next Time: I would bring a small bag for Four. She received a tiny trinket from nearly every place we visited and kids LOVE that stuff, would be good to have a special place for them. I would also love to do more outfit stuff next time, the costumes on everyone were awesome! I would just keep in mind the following: Linen and cotton ONLY, no polyester fabrics. Would have been nice to have a more aesthetic hat and a cuter parasol type situation. Parent Pointers: This event was super family friendly, as I hope you can see from my report. LOADS of families of all ages. If you have a wagon-style stroller that definitely seemed like the ticket. Ground is bumpy so you’ll need all terrain wheels if you bring a push stroller. Wish I had packed wet wipes and lysol wipes. We found that every event had shade, but the trick was arriving 5 minutes early so you could snag a good shady spot. Four complained ceaselessly if in the sun longer than 5 minutes, so for us hopping between stages made the most sense. There are no refillable water stations, and the water for sale is 4$ a bottle cash only so pack tons. We passed several change table nursing stations that are well marked if you need that. Lost Children marker is right by the entrance, Medical tent is off the food court. Unexpected: Tipping! I’ve never been to a Renaissance Faire, and every act we saw asked for tips. Some even had their Venmo tag. You weren’t obligated to but it was quite interesting. Final Thoughts: This was super fun and we will go again next year, though definitely on a Sunday not a Saturday. Arriving early and leaving late appeared to be key for our smooth experience– I see from the FB page that departing in the late afternoon was a shitshow. If we hadn’t come in one car I would have attempted to take Four home after the puppet show, but she honestly managed really well even beyond her limits and I was very proud of her. I was glad we had made a plan the night before and would do so again, because I felt like we saw nearly everything we wanted to see. TL;DR It was fun! Arrive early, leave late, bring sunscreen and extra extra extra water.\n",

      "Using Affordable Housing to get on The Property Ladder in Seattle. The median home price in Seattle is now $934K. A few years back I decided to settle down and buy a house, but I couldn't come up with $200K for a down payment. I used a fairly convoluted method to deal with that. Someone on the forum asked me to elaborate how and why I did that, so I thought I'd make a post. When we started dating, we were looking at places that were really farther from Seattle than is ideal. Even places in Lynnwood were stretching our budget. We were in a conundrum, where it felt like our only option was having some nightmarish commute from Everett, or renting indefinitely. When the median home price in Seattle was $449K, it was $182K in Las Vegas. So we bought a place out there, and rented it out. Homes were so cheap, one of the problems we had was getting financing. Not because we couldn't qualify. But because the loans were so small the banks didn't want to do them. I learned that banks basically won't do loans for a home if the balance is under $100K. I know that people think that a 15% year-over-year increase in home prices seems like a lot, but Seattle Portland San Francisco Los Angeles are way in the back of the pack when it comes to this stuff. For instance, Vegas is up 30.5% in the last year. The way that you make money on real estate is really basic: Can you borrow the money at a lower rate than what the property is going up? If yes, you make money. For instance, in 2020 you could borrow at 3%. So if you invested a million in real estate in Vegas in 2021, you'd be up about $305K today, and you would have spent $30,000 to borrow the money, leaving you a profit of about $275K. in 2006 you could borrow at 6%. So if you invested a million in real estate in 2006, it was a wash. Basically once you paid your property taxes and you paid for maintenance, all your profits had disappeared. So if you're looking to buy affordable property, you might consider looking at areas that are already performing well. \"Past performance is not indicative of future results.\" But real estate trends tend to move slowly. One of the things that helps me sleep better at night is the realization that if you were looking at the right stats in 2005, you could have seen the 2007 Bubble coming and got out before it hit. Hint: look at inventory stats. Also, the money tends to accumulate in a hurry. We went from $35K to invest on a $135K house to where we're at now, which is that we can afford to live almost anywhere, even on modest I.T. salaries. A few months ago we were considering a place for $4m. We decided to pass on it and just bought another investment property. In a nutshell, once you've got $1M under management, your investments are making you wealthier than your day job is. So it's not like you have to be the CEO of a tech company to accumulate millions; once you hit a certain level of wealth it tends to accumulate on it's own. If you put $35K into an Everett fixer-upper in 2012 you'd have about half a million today. If you did the same trick every other year for ten years, you'd be a multi-millionaire. Personally, I am a big fan of investing in the cities where Californians are flocking to. I think you could spend the rest of your life profiting from the exodus from California. If you take the states from that infographic and you put their big cities in a spreadsheet, I guarantee you that everyone of them is going up double digits in price. During yesterday's discussion on the topic, a lot of people were saying that \"California isn't shrinking.\" I think the thing that people don't realize about California, is that for every million people who LEAVE California there's a million who arrive from abroad. When I moved from the Seattle area to California, literally 75% of my neighbors were from China, Korea and India. First generation Americans, moving to California largely for tech jobs. This influx creates a never ending exodus OUT of California. I'm on an Internet forum for people who are leaving California, and nearly 100% of them are middle class people who have $500K-$1M in equity and are moving to lower COL areas. So you can tap that demographic until the end of time, if you're willing to be a landlord. Obviously, you won't be renting to the people leaving California, you'll be renting to the people in the cities where Californians are moving to. Basically the exodus of Californians is a boon for property owners in the cities where Californians are heading. Please do your own research, but here's some of mine: Bend Oregon has a median home price of $732K and has gone up 32.4% in the last year. St George UT has a median home price of $535K and has gone up 38.9% in the last year. Spokane has a median home price of $400K and has gone up 27.6% in the last year. Those are just three. YMMV, but to me, the investments that are reliably great are where Californians are headed. You could even make a solid argument that Seattle has benefited from decades of Californians bailing and moving here. I know this post sounds like some kind of infomercial. I have nothing to sell. I am just a dude who used to make the Godawful commute to work and I reached a point where I was like \"there's gotta be a better way.\" I didn't even get into real estate out of any \"love\" for the industry, I was purely looking for a way for my wife and I to afford a house that was reasonably sized and not too far from work. We were totally priced out, so we invested elsewhere, then cashed out once we'd accumulated enough to get what we really wanted in the first place. Another \"side benefit\" here, is that getting a bunch of loans over time juices your credit score to a ridiculous degree. When I first started working in Washington, my score was so bad I couldn't even get a credit card.\n",

      "Softball Leagues Hi all! Just moved to Seattle and I love to play softball and looking for a little a bit of help finding a team league. Seeking a Friday night or Saturday morning league for the fall. Open to men’s, co-ed, slow pitch or fast pitch that is more competitive than not. Ideally double headers, but ok if not. Willing to drive up to 45 mins in any direction from south Seattle. I was able to find Underdog on Google, but didn’t look like there was any Friday or Saturday options, and no double headers. Was thinking there may be better options slightly outside the city. Also would love to know of any pickup games going on during the week. Please comment or shoot me a DM if you know of anything. Thanks in advance!\n",

      "Hey everyone! I just wanted to introduce myself again. My name is George, and I am a rising junior at Stanford interested in civic engagement and politics. I started working on a project with other students that’s been totally awesome and cool. Basically, we’ve made a newsletter that summarizes the info from Seattle City Council meetings in an accessible and easy way. I have put an example from this week below, though the real thing has a bit more formatting that doesn't translate into Reddit. This project is very new, so we would really appreciate any feedback you may have! I would love to see comments and show me what I need to do to make this newsletter the best it can be. I totally recommend joining! Who doesn’t want to know what goes on behind the scenes of their own beautiful city? If you are interested in receiving these weekly in your email inbox, you can click this link: [https://forms.gle/Yxo5fevVhVWmwcB78](https://forms.gle/Yxo5fevVhVWmwcB78)\n",

And the further you dig into the source of that quote or the culture he’s informed, the more obvious it becomes that the decision to shoot 6 innocent bystanders in Denver was made in a classroom. In this classroom, pupils were taught to recognize split second decision making as cause to shoot - which is far different than training to make the right split second decision and then fostering a culture that enforces expectations of accuracy. Nonetheless, it will likely be decried as cherry picking to suggest that the argument for restricting police use of force is six times stronger than arguments in favor of officer discretion, given what happened in Denver. But that strength differential is not for the simple fact that Denver police shot six innocent people in a failed attempt to kill a man who’d surrendered. No, it’s because police authorities in Denver, like everywhere else in this nation, won’t straightaway condemn such acts or the mindset and training that delivered such results – because they’re blue line extremists willing to trade the well being of 6 innocent bystanders for phantoms of faith.\n",

Because, clearly, a thousand people shot dead by police each year nationwide is too high a bar.

And that, therefore, the flagship content of blue line ideology is propagandist fiction? I mean, the majority of police deaths are traffic related, which is probably not unrelated to the fact that so many police refuse to buckle up – though they’ll write you a ticket for doing the same. Similarly, the 55% spike in police deaths from 2020 to 2021 is attributable to COVID related deaths, which is probably not unrelated to the fact that so many police refused to wear masks – even when mandated by laws they enforced against others.

Instead, it’s simply a testament to how extreme policing has been allowed to become. This is thanks to the persistent and growing dereliction of our judiciary.

      "The “court created doctrine” of qualified immunity is likely the most notorious legal delusion of them all. This doctrine holds that police are immune from civil liability except where it can be shown that an officer has violated an individual’s “clearly established rights.” While lay people such as myself widely regard our first and fourth amendment rights as pretty fucking clearly established, that is not how this works. The test for whether or not an officer has violated clearly established rights comes down to whether or not the officer “reasonably” knew their actions would violate an individual’s rights.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In Texas in 2020, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it wasn’t reasonable to expect a corrections officer to understand that an unprovoked pepper spray attack against an inmate would violate his rights, because the case cited by the plaintiff to demonstrate a clearly established right concerned prison guards beating and tasing inmates – not pepper spraying them. In essence, qualified immunity invokes the irrelevant to practically guarantee officers freedom from civil liability and it turns the concept of reasonableness into a brazen display of unlikely ignorance. And better still, since it was ruled that unprovoked pepper spray attacks against inmates warrant qualified immunity, the right to be free from such attacks by demented prison guards has become clearly unestablished.\n",

      "A similar perversion of reasonableness is found in the 1989 supreme court ruling GrahamVConnor. The court confirmed in Graham that excessive force claims against police should be evaluated with respect to the “objective reasonableness” standard of the 4th Amendment. This test considers the severity of the suspect’s alleged crime, the threat level posed by the suspect and whether or not the suspect is resisting or evading. But, and here’s the kicker, those factors must be considered with respect for the fact that officers may be compelled to engage in split second decision making and “from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\" So, in practice, the “objective” reasonableness test dictated in Graham boils down to asking officers accused of excessive force whether or not they’re guilty. Because what cop would testify to perceptions that would cast their use of force in an “unreasonable” light? The result of this standard is that trigger-happy rambo cops have become the template for what passes as a “reasonable officer.”\n",

These vary from state to state and from one police department to the next but in either case they often afford police due process rights beyond those available to ordinary citizens accused of crimes. Police unions argue that these are necessary to protect police from overzealous prosecutors and internal affairs. But it’s far easier to find hundreds of examples of these protecting police from warranted accountability – see Freddy Gray, for example – than it is to find even a single case of a police officer being victimized by a bad faith prosecution. Police are rarely charged, much less prosecuted, for abuses that are clearly unreasonable and unjustified by any standard definition of those terms. Furthermore, special favors written into the law strike against the legitimacy of our entire legal system, given that legal authority in the US uniquely depends on the rule of law, which basically holds that the law should be enforced equally against all, according to the internet.\n",

      "Last night I sent an email to my Seattle School Board Director (Chandra Hampson - SPS district 3) via her [seattleschools.com](http://seattleschools.com/) email address, sharing my thoughts about the strike and union demands, and asking that the board won't file an injunction against the striking teachers. I was surprised this morning when Chandra called me directly and offered to discuss all my concerns. What an amazing opportunity! Luckily I was at my desk and ready to take notes. She has time for calling one constituent each day, and I was fortunate enough to be free at the time when she did call, and had already written out a lot of questions and thoughts because of the ongoing strike. We had an hour-long discussion and I asked about the strike, the teacher demands, the comprehensive school board plan details listed on the district website, etc. Hampson was super focused to get me answers and I'm thankful for her time. Below are my notes from the conversation, and I tried to leave out my own commentary or editorializing and focus on her responses (until the very end).\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Hampson has 3 kids in the Seattle public schools, 2 of them have 504s in place, and they went to Sandpoint Elementary. As a parent she is also dealing with her kids being out of school due to the negotiations and strike. She has been in the role of teacher, parent, and now elected to the Seattle School Board.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Hampson wanted to clarify a couple things about roles and responsibilities of the different groups involved. As a parent I was also quite confused about what the focus and role are of the School Board and the district, compared to the teacher's union, and how each side is involved in the ongoing contract negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Before diving in - Hampson shared the Lighthouse study on school boards, results of which are driving how school boards are being structured around the country. It's the largest study on school board performance and is guiding our current board's methods for their own structures and policies: [https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED453172](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED453172)\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "A school board director job is entirely about governance, not customer support, meaning: they are responsible with setting the direction of the schooling, curriculum decisions, guidance towards classroom and school best practices, and ensuring that schools have resources available to execute on planned changes. In the context of the inclusivity model (more on that later) Hampson clarified the School Board's job is to provide the direction and the goals for the inclusion, clarify what is required (at federal, state levels) and what is not permitted by law. The director position is not like other elected officials because the school board is elected to represent the students first and foremost, and the community in which they live. It is \"the worst elected job\" because of how thankless their efforts are but also how impactful the decisions become. Hampson was very clear that the board \"doesn't represent teachers or parents, but instead represents the entire community when making decisions\". They have to think of what's best for the entire community in Seattle, not one specific interest group or demographic.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Because the directors are so focused on governance they do not have time for \"customer support\". They do often help connect parents with resources, or help solve problems at specific schools in their coverage. They're full-time focus, however, is governance and decision making. Some tactical changes are being made to address the problems around customer service. Right now the board has hired a consultancy to perform a full communications audit of the district to try and figure out where and how they can improve communications internal and external, and it's up to the superintendent to get the district staff to provide all the data and information. Additionally, the board is aware that they need to create a high-value customer service department to handle the myriad problems parents face when trying to navigate district policies and processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "The community needs to understand that the only non-district entity involved is the SEA teachers union - by definition the union is created to advocate for teachers and teacher negotiation, but the district and board are created to support the students and drive student success. This may seem like semantics, but it's a very clear distinction that the SEA union is an external entity that is hired to do a job, much like an attorney is when representing clients. The union will use every tactic to get what they need for their members because that is their primary purpose for which they are hired, even if it isn't best for the students. They will use spin and stalling tactics, and others to get the agreed-upon list of demands. The union is looking at teacher advocacy, not student success. The difference can seem subtle at first glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Now to a primary sticking point of the ongoing strike and negotiations: data and real-world experiences in other districts and states show that an inclusion model will get us out of being stuck with the problems the schools face when dumping money and resources into SEL/multilingual and special ed, but not getting results or pushing the needle. Last year, the existing model used in Seattle schools poured $120M in addition to all the state funding, but the results were abysmal. Everyone, across the board, including teachers, staff, admins all believe that the goals and results of a properly-executed inclusivity program at the district level is not only achievable, but is the right path to follow. It's clear that the 1:1 model of assignment for SEL does not produce the desired (or federally mandated) results, and it just segregates students, often along demographic lines that are historically underperforming. The board believes that if we don't start with the inclusion mechanisms this year we may never catch up to the goals set by law.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "In response to the need for the inclusivity model the SEA teachers union created a task force to come up with a plan on how to rollout and execute in the schools, and to determine which resource would be needed. The board is 100% behind the task force's plan toward inclusion, and also getting the staff the resources they need to implement it. To support the plan the School Board determined that no changes to staffing ratios will happen in the 2022/23 school year, and instead the year should be used for onboarding teachers and admins, support training, and build out curricular resources for inclusion. For this first year the School Board is asking for a 1-year contract. The plan will take 5-10 years to unwind and rebuild for full implementation, and it's clear that things will be more expensive at first before efficiencies materialize to decrease cost over a few years, and to achieve all the expected student results. The board is trying to update and modernize the practices of the district because it's clear that many students are not getting the experience and opportunities they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "I asked Hampson what the role of a director is in the current strike. She believes that the board and district didn't do enough to inform teachers and parents during the pandemic that this large uplift is coming. For that reason, and others, there is a real trust gap, and also a belief gap - people don't believe that the school board is reformed in their direction and their commitment to the schools and teachers. The school board is primarily responsible for the belief gap. The last superintendent put out communications that weren't true, but the new board and district staff are committed to be ing extremely fact-based. The superintendent has been directed to focus solely on student issues.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a director, Hampson is staying focused on the specific goals set for the district - things that must be done or are not allowed. The board is keeping students at the center of their focus. Sometimes that means asking tough questions like \"can we afford this?\" Right now the SEA union is asking for $500M, but the planned investment in school resources is already greater than what we currently spend. No one is saying \"screw the inclusion thing\" and everyone agrees with the goals, however there is disagreement on how to get there. The current board cannot agree to things that will result in a deficit for the next board.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Okay, so what's the plan to get teachers and parents onboarded? Hampson has many points on what the board is doing to get us from here to there. First is addressing the big trust gap with the community. The first year of implementation is meant to be an onboarding time to work on aligning everyone on the process and goals, hence the board asking for a 1-year contract. The district will add additional staff, and provide training opportunities for teachers, admins, and staff, on how to handle the transition to the inclusivity model. Not every classroom will become an inclusion classroom. The board is also reminding everyone that change is hard, especially transitioning from Seattle \"talking progressively\" about education and inclusivity to switching into execution mode and making actual changes that implement the goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "Many other tactical changes are happening. We have a brand new superintendent that is an expert in governance. The superintendent job is not like school-administration, but rather has to be someone who is an expert in governance; this encompasses an entirely different skill set than a former principle or school administrator. This is the first time that a superintendent is hired for that particular skill set, and we haven't yet had the time to see what exactly that means at the scale of SPS because of his short tenure thus far. The board is also asking the state and colleges to mandate teacher and administrator inclusivity and special ed training for all teachers graduating to work in our districts. It's not currently required and has created a huge deficit in teacher abilities in working with inclusion classrooms. The district is also buying curriculum for the first time. What that means is teachers will have curriculum that is uniform across the district, pre-made for them to use, and they will be able to train on the curriculum to avoid surprises or having to fall back to previous year's plans. The curricular support is aimed to reduce teacher burden so they can focus on classroom time more, and student interaction and not the overhead of building out curriculum. Individual plans do not scale to a system as large as SPS, and having uniformity makes for easier teacher onboarding and long-term success.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My parting thoughts: I'm really thankful that I had the chance for a real discussion with a board member. It's not often that we can hear directly from decision makers and get responses to our questions without a news source or press release as an intermediary. It gives me validation that there are real people doing the hard work in those jobs. As a parent, Hampson knows what it's like working with the district, and going through the 504 and IEP process with her own children, and she knows the pains we feel watching these bureaucratic processes take place. Our feelings as parents and community members right now are very real, and the frustration is felt from all sides. I got the impression that Hampson and the school board are genuinely invested in the success and future of Seattle schools, students, and the community. I hope that we can all come together and collaborate for the sake of our students and for Seattle.\n",

There were portapotties in the lot, so we made use and then wandered up to the gate. It was a bit chaotic but there was a man yelling directions so we paused to hear them. There was only one line- everyone had to go up to the cashiers to either purchase tickets or have prepurchased tickets validated and receive a stamp. The line moved fast once they opened around 945 and we were in by 10:10.\n",

      "Maps, menus, and the event schedule were posted by QR code all over the place, and each venue had its schedule posted out front, BUT the data that day was not working at all. We could SMS text or call, but data was not happening, which was annoying but not the event’s fault. We had made a must-see list Saturday night off the website and one of our group had the foresight to screenshot the map so we were able to navigate fine before we got our bearings. Some of the things we saw were in the same venue, others were elsewhere, so a lot of our vendor shopping happened as we moved between venues.\n",

      "1100 First Joust- Fun!!! The first joust of the day was all tests of skill. Each section cheered for a different knight and the section leaders were great. Four thought it was boring (?! I know), so we split from the others before the end for her to have her face painted. She really really liked this. It was totally smeared off by the end of the day, but her joy made it worth the 25$. \n",
      "\n",
      "1200 Lunch- It was SUPER busy in the lunch area, this was kind of where the umbrella came in most handy to create portable shade while you’re standing waiting. Seating was tough to find- there was a LOT but table turnover wasn’t really happening, so we sat on the ground in the shade. Vegetarian options were a bit thin and almost all the food was hot which was rough. Expensive too but of course that’s no surprise for faire food. Four ordered a plain hamburger and ate only the top bun and the fries. The King of Spain came and performed quite a funny burlesque show for the eating crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "100 Cydshow Cy the Sword Swallower- This was by far the most anticipated thing for Four, and she loved it. It’s not for the squeamish (like myself); one our group members split to peruse the vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "130 Mermaid and Fairy Glen- Four was absolutely entranced by the mermaid and had a lot of fun interacting with the fairies. She really enjoyed the bubbles too. There was a colouring space but every single sheet was completely coloured, which was a bummer.\n",
      "\n",
      "200 Princess Tea- Back at the Sweden tent we adults lounged around in the shade while the 15 kids sat round a table for tea, lemonade, and cupcakes. Each kid got a gold paper crown and a little pinned badge with a unicorn. Princess Cecilia served the drinks while her sister told the table a story about her unicorn. She was really lovely, clearly had a lot of experience with kids. Once the meal was finished everyone got to go and pet the bunnies and feed the miniature ponies.\n",
      "\n",
      "300 Storytime with the Wytchwood Players- this was my favourite thing!!! The lady told a wide variety of stories, her voice carried magnificently and she was really engaging. She also introduced a \\~10 year old girl and explained she’s still learning and would be telling us the story of how Thor got his hammer. All the adults paid rapt attention, she was soooo nervous it was super sweet.\n",

      "330 IPad time- Four was flagging hard at this point and becoming quite wiggly. We were staying in the nice cool tent for the puppet show at 400, so I whipped out the iPad and loaded up a movie. We attracted two more kids to the ipad, which gave all us parents a chance to rest and chill. Our other two adults ventured into the afternoon heat to bring back snow cones and a strawberry lemonade, both of which received huge thumbs up from Four.\n",

      "445 Sirena- We split the group for the other two adults to go see the final joust at 500 since Four didn’t enjoy the morning joust. Four wanted to hear music so we walked over to the village square to see Sirena. I thought these ladies were awesome, I loved their coordinated dancing and singing and drumming and the vibe was ethereal and spooky. Four did not love it, so we left to walk over to the jousting area to see if we could meet up with the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "500 Final Joust- We were late to the joust and it was the last of the day, so it was a solid wall of people all the way around the ring. Four and I found a spot in the shade to wait until it was over. The other adults report that they sat front row on the ground and had a great view in the shade. This joust actually involved the competitors riding at each other! The cheering was exciting and I could sort of see from my spot. The event ended about 530 and it seemed like most folks headed for the gates\n",
      "\n",
      "545 Dinner?- I walked over alone to see about scrounging up dinner and bringing it back to the group. This was Sunday and obviously almost closing time, a LOT of places were out of food, particularly anything vegetarian. Returned empty handed.\n",
      "\n",
      "600 Equestrian Chaos- Ladies on horseback doing trick archery shots. The other two liked this, I kind of thought it was just OK. Four had absolutely had it and spent the entire time lying on the bleachers flopping around. She got to pet one of the horses at the end which perked her up.\n",
      "\n",
      "645 Headed Home- Carried Four back to the car and we all used the toilet a final time. It took us sub 10 minutes to get out, totally unremarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stuff for Next Time: I would bring a small bag for Four. She received a tiny trinket from nearly every place we visited and kids LOVE that stuff, would be good to have a special place for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would also love to do more outfit stuff next time, the costumes on everyone were awesome! I would just keep in mind the following: Linen and cotton ONLY, no polyester fabrics. Would have been nice to have a more aesthetic hat and a cuter parasol type situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parent Pointers: This event was super family friendly, as I hope you can see from my report. LOADS of families of all ages. If you have a wagon-style stroller that definitely seemed like the ticket. Ground is bumpy so you’ll need all terrain wheels if you bring a push stroller. Wish I had packed wet wipes and lysol wipes. We found that every event had shade, but the trick was arriving 5 minutes early so you could snag a good shady spot. Four complained ceaselessly if in the sun longer than 5 minutes, so for us hopping between stages made the most sense. There are no refillable water stations, and the water for sale is 4$ a bottle cash only so pack tons. We passed several change table/nursing stations that are well marked if you need that. Lost Children marker is right by the entrance, Medical tent is off the food court.\n",

      "Final Thoughts: This was super fun and we will go again next year, though definitely on a Sunday not a Saturday. Arriving early and leaving late appeared to be key for our smooth experience– I see from the FB page that departing in the late afternoon was a shitshow. If we hadn’t come in one car I would have attempted to take Four home after the puppet show, but she honestly managed really well even beyond her limits and I was very proud of her. I was glad we had made a plan the night before and would do so again, because I felt like we saw nearly everything we wanted to see.\n",
