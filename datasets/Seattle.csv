It will not hurt someone who is not having an overdose, because it only binds to opioid receptors. So if the person is on something else, or not in full overdose, they’ll be annoyed but not harmed.

I’m a Canadian with about 8 years of history of doc prescribing opioid pain medication. I got the H1N1 vaccination back in the day and it messed up my life. I had a bad allergic reaction to it and now I get allergic reactions and inflammation all the time. I developed a host of problems and have seen lots of specialists. Tired a lot of different meds and the only thing that worked was pain meds (and others). I have Lupus and get a lot of flare ups in my digestive tract that cause me to get severe cramping in my gut. I’m with Kaiser and the PCP given to me just does not give a F about me. She hasn’t looked at my file and just said Kaiser doesn’t have anything for pain management unless I want to taper off and she isn’t going to take over the script. Even after reviewing my last 10 yr history.  What pisses me off is that she has no interest in helping me figure out what’s wrong or how to manage it. I’m going back and forth now and getting the Rx filled with my doc in Canada. Problem is that I’m not technically here and am seeing specialists here so my doc back home isn’t going to keep writing these. 
I’m probably going to leave Kaiser because none of the specialists I’ve seen have been helpful and prescribe meds that’s I’ve had a bad reaction to in the past.  The Rheumatologist said that I have Sjogrens and told me to “read up”on it and get back to him. My medical file has 20 rheumatologist who couldn’t figure out my blood work. One rheumatologist would send me to another rheumatologist and that rheumatologist would send me to another specialist. Yet this doctor at Kaiser made a diagnosis based on one set of blood tests. I don’t believe that they care about their patients at all. 
In 2020 I was set to have Cataract surgery in Canada and well the world shut down. I stayed in WA and got coverage.  It’s been 2 years of steroid eye drops because my eye inflammation is not “controlled” and I can’t see anything. Doc in Canada was ready to do surgery but for some reason they won’t schedule me. Im done with this network. So 2 questions 1) Any doctor recommendations and 2) what’s a good plan that gives me access to a lot of specialists.

The killer was so confident no one would try to apprehend him that he *walked* off, and was witnessed walking over the Jose Rizal “green bridge” to Beacon Hill before reaching the safety of obscurity.
He was right to be confident, it turns out, as police did not arrive at the scene of the murder for a full hour. 
Murder is common among Seattle’s homeless. Apart from several other tales I’ve heard of second hand from homeless people, this is the second witness account of a homeless murder I’ve been told in 6 months. The first was from a man who was riding the bus down Jackson when he saw two men arguing on the street. One man pulled out a gun and shot the other man once in the head, then several more times after he fell. This happened in front of a bus full of witnesses. The man made no attempt to disguise himself, but still wasn’t caught. I’ve also heard 2 victims’ accounts of their attempted murders—one woman had to escape from an abandoned house after being stabbed in the back multiple times. A man had to crawl from his RV to the street after being shot in the chest and left for dead. Several witnesses did nothing because the killer told them he would shoot them if he found out they called for help. 
No one cares about these murders. They’re often only known of among the homeless, most of whom are very reluctant to call the police out of fear and because the police can’t really do anything about it, but they happen often. Homeless people often just “disappear”.
What makes this recent murder stand out is the slow police response despite multiple 911 calls. The police see this kind of thing often, and no one is advocating for the victims, no witnesses will disclose the identity of killers… they’re all too scared they’ll be called a snitch or a cop caller. People get murdered for that kind of thing in a community that’s stopped valuing life. And apparently the police have stopped valuing lives in that community too. Apparently there are more important things for cops to deal with than homeless murders.
I have a couple reasons for telling you this—I want you to understand the kind of peril homeless people live in. I don’t know this as a fact but I’m pretty sure the vast majority of homeless people have not, would not and will not murder anyone. But with all uncensored drug and other criminal activity and the unstable living, and mainly out of their own fear, a certain percentage will become violent. The homeless constantly have to watch their back. It’s easy to get stuck in debt when they’re lucky to have even a tent wall protecting them and their valuables from thieving neighbors. Even without debt, all it takes is a misunderstanding, or saying the wrong thing to the wrong person and their life could be in danger. And if they get killed, no one will do anything. Even if they’re shot on the street in public, the killer won’t get caught. If they’re killed in the jungle their body will get dumped somewhere in the jungle and no one will know what happened—they’ll just disappear, and if anyone even cares enough to look for them, no one, not even a cop, is going to search the jungle.
It’s true that many of the homeless have been given the opportunity to get out and change their lives. Rather than pointing that out as more evidence that their lives are worthless, consider that when not just a few but most of the people in a group—especially such a large group as the Seattle homeless—behave a certain way, it would be tragically misguided and maybe even arrogant to label that behavior outrageous or anomalous. Despite what we’d like to believe, it would be wise to assume their behavior approximately corresponds to what *any* similarly sized group would do in their situation and that speaks volumes. 
My second reason for telling you this is as a warning. So far, the violence has been contained within the homeless community, allowing us to distance the experiences of our homeless neighbors from our own. It’s only a matter of time though, till the violence spills over to our side of the fence.",True,False,False,Seattle,t5_2qhad,476248,public,self,"Yesterday I heard an account of a homeless man who was sitting next to his friend when a masked man walked up and shot the friend in the head several times, killing him.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/xqmgew/yesterday_i_heard_an_account_of_a_homeless_man/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boarded the LR for a ride to the Airport. When I walked into a car and sat down a youngish mentally ill woman in baggy jeans, a coat, and a large collection of key chain like items was in the midst of some rambling and insults. The aura she gave was someone who enjoyed partying at one point in her life as a form of self medication but has since been consumed by mental illness. I don't interact with her and just start browsing on my phone as I ride the rail. I begin to realize she's having a one sided conversation at me and don't really interact. She begins to say disordered and derogatory things and questions. At one point she keeps talking about how I said I wanted to piss in my mom's mouth, she tried to tell other passengers I had a bomb, she asked if I had been in the military, she asked if I wanted to be a Russian air strike, if I had sucked dick, done coke, she seriously asked questions sometimes actual questions sometimes word salad at me for about 45 minutes without me interacting or responding. From time to time she would shout loudly to try to get me to flinch. At one point she brought out a laser and tried shining it, the closer we got to the airport the more she escalated the attempts to get my attention. She then followed me into the airport and started screaming and hitting objects on the walk way. I finally tricked her and ducked down into the parking garage as she was screaming and knocking over a few plastic signs. However this clever manuever could not escape her persistence, she wandered through ticketing until she found me, and followed me to TSA lines, where she then stopped because she didn't have a boarding pass. 

Having dealt with crazy people before, I decided to just not react and keep an eye out on her using the windows and reflections around the link. It was clear she was escalating her behavior the closer I was to leaving. The only time I felt like an issue could break out was when she seemingly asked if I wanted to get maced but I doubt she would have actually been able to mace me effectively.

A search for zoo doo in this subreddit didn't come up with answers and the zoo hasn't yet responded to my inquiry. Plus, I'm curious to hear other lessons learned from folks. 

1) do you need to pay for admission to the zoo to collect the doo? 

2) how does collection work? I'm planning to buy 25 gal, do i show up with a shovel, enough containers equaling 25 gal and scoop it myself? Or do they just have the order ready for pickup?

3) i read on the website that the compost is already cured, so I'm assuming it has no odor, the texture probably is mulch-like (but no big chunks and color variation). Would love confirmation that this is true.

4) anybody have any fun stories regarding their zoo doo acquisition ? Best puns and explanations to family as to why you bought XX gal of poop?

Any post I search about Seattle public schools is overwhelmingly negative. Why is that? If we look at test scores, Seattle public schools is not that bad. Sure in comparison too many school districts on the Eastside like Bellevue, Mercer Island, Kirkland, Redmond, and Sammamish they are not as good, but that to be expected considering that everyone who lives in the Eastside is a well-off techie.

If we were to compared [SPS](https://www.greatschools.org/washington/seattle/seattle-public-schools/) to say [Edmonds School District](https://www.greatschools.org/washington/lynnwood/edmonds-school-district/) Seattle public schools has about the same number of people people performing average or above average, however, Seattle public has significantly more people performing above average in comparison to Edmonds. This is pretty good if you were to compare it so something like [LAUSD](https://www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/los-angeles-unified-school-district/) where almost 50% of students aren't not evening meeting the statewide standards. (Frankly LAUSD is in a different state and the standards in California are higher, but my point still stands).

Most schools north of the Ship Canal or in Queen Anne / Magnolia seem to perform quite highly in terms in terms of test scores i.e. 9/10 or 10/10.

It makes me wonder what's with the bad rap the SPS gets, which makes people say that you should avoid it or send your kids to private schools?

Late on the night of 9/25 or the early morning hours of 9/26 a friend of mine had her work vehicle with all of her tools stolen.
During the Covid Lockdown she changed jobs from being a pastry chef (and working at 3 different locations to make ends meet) to being a contractor/handyman.
I'm hoping for any tips or sightings on the vehicle, or possibly notices a sudden abundance of well used Ryobi power tools for sale at Pawn Shops, seen on Offer Up/Craigslist, or heard of through a ""friend of a friend"".
This van and it's contents hold all of her means to make an income, and she's totally screwed without them.
The vehicle is a White 2002 Chevy Express Van.
It was pretty dirty looking, and the white paint is starting to come off down the drivers side middway down the body. It has Washington Plates, #BZF1259.
It was parked in the Wallingford area, about 2 blocks South of the Dicks on 45th.
The specific cross streets she gave me were NE 43rd St and 2nd Ave NE.
So if you live in the area (or... I dunno, commute around there?) and happened to notice anything peculiar in the area that night please, PLEASE reach out to me!
She's a great person just trying to make a living, and she's had that opportunity stolen from her.

He literally followed me around the ENTIRETY of my grocery shopping *down into the parking garage.* It was so creepy, and felt so unsafe, and it was so disturbing, that I reported him to the Safeway. Safeway informed me that I am not the first person to report his behavior. Please watch out.

“Roger” is a short man approximately 50 years of age. He has shoulder length curly, scraggly hair and he was wearing a jacket and a cap. He has white bug eyes with creepy dilated pupils, that make him look intoxicated.

I (40F) went to the lower Queenanne Safeway to grocery shop last night at approximately 8:30 PM. An employee followed me around and stared at me and tried to engage me in conversation literally the entire 20 minute time that I was shopping.

F irst, I went to the back of the store with my cart to the pharmacy section. I left my cart parked *out of the way* of traffic in the aisle kitty corner to me. As I was perusing various antacids, this creepy, CREEPY man came walking up to me, pushing my cart. He parked it right in the middle of the aisle, and asked me if it was my cart. I glared at him and told him that it was. He then said “people leave these carts all over the place and you never know who it belongs to.” I was taking aback at how weird this was. 

(Because “Roger” was wearing a jacket, I could not see that he was wearing a name tag). He was acting so weird and he looked so downtrodden, that I assumed that he was simply some bum from the neighborhood. 

I was very irritated, and creeped out, but I am not easily intimidated. I shook it off. 

But the way he was staring at me, his eyes were narrowed and wide and crazy looking, and his glare had a antagonistic and predatory feeling to it. 

I felt patently unsafe.

I finish my shopping and rolled my cart to the front of the store where the checkers are. As I was in line to check out, I looked up and saw him again staring at me. This time he was lurking by the bagging area in the checkout line next to me that was closed. His eyes absolutely drilled into me. At this point. I started to get scared.

It was at this point that he moved a little bit and his jacket came open to *reveal his name tag.* This guy WORKS THERE.” 

I went through the checkout line and went to push my cart over to the elevator to go downstairs to the parking area where my car was. To my horror and absolute confusion, here was the same guy lingering over by the elevator not doing anything. Just lingering there staring at me. 

(At this point… at this point, I don’t know. It starts to be a little bit of a haze and blur. I have PTSD from a lot of bad stuff that’s happened, and some men scare the shit out of me. If I pick up on a predatory vibe from a man, I immediately go into fight or flight. That’s what happened last night. Everything about him was horrifying. Predatory. If he wanted to hurt me. It felt dangerous and I think I went into a little bit of shock).

Anyway, as I was waiting for the elevator, he went to walk down the stairs. He wasn’t doing anything or holding anything, he just walked down the stairs so that he would be there when I got out of the elevator at the bottom floor. He was standing there aimlessly holding a cart. Just standing there but *staring at me so scary that I felt like he wanted to hurt me.*

There were no other people in the parking garage. I was all alone down there, it was just me and him. Like something out of a horror movie.

Scared, I drilled my eyes into his and summoned as much courage I could muster. We were alone in the parking garage, and my gut was screaming flashing red at me that this was unsafe.

I said, “WHAT is your PROBLEM. You have been *staring at me and following me around the entire time that I’ve been here.* It is so offputting and I do not know why you’re doing that. What is your problem?”

He immediately snapped back at me “WHAT. IM JUST GETTING THIS CART.” So defensive. Scary because he was so violently angry. 

It was at this point that I felt an immediate and critical need to get the fuck out of there. I think I told him off one more time as i pushed my cart to my car. I think he turned around and went back upstairs without the cart. I don’t know I was just so focused on getting out of there.

I was shaking. Driving home is a little bit of a blur, because I couldn’t process what just happened. Nothing about what just happened made any sense. How could he be so patently and obviously stalking me the entire time? It was like he wasn’t even trying to hide it. It was like he was getting off on making me feel unsafe, like this was some sort of a game for him.

At this point I called Safeway and spoke to an assistant manager, he was extremely helpful. He immediately identified the name of this employee (“Roger”) based on my description. 

But moreover, told me that *I am not the first person to complain about him.*

*This man is a sexual predator, and I’d die on that hill.* 

Between my gut instinct and intuition, and his ridiculously obvious stalking of me, and staring at me, I have zero doubt that this man is a sexual predator. I bet any woman knows exactly what I’m talking about at this point. When you get that feeling, you just know. When you know, you know. 

And that’s when you get the fuck out of there, because you are in danger.

The assistant manager could not have been more kind and apologetic, and validated what happened. (I could say more about that interaction, but I was instructed to call back during business hours and speak to the general manager and I don’t want to divulge anything that was said between myself and the assistant manager until them. Other than the fact that I was 100% validated).

I hope this disgusting creep gets fired, ASAP. I would never go back to that store knowing that he works there. The behavior was so aggressively and purposely scary, I wish I could report him to the police for something. 

He knew what he was doing, he was doing it on purpose, and he was getting off on doing it. And I’m not the first woman he’s done it to, and unless he gets fired, I won’t be the last.

Once again, he is approximately 50M, small and short with shoulder length scraggly curly hair, and he looks vaguely downtrodden as if he were homeless. (No offense to homeless people).

The DJ trio of Karim, DJ Scene, and Destro form the [Boom Bap Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_Bap_Project), a northwest hip hop group. The hard-hitting versus of *Welcome to Seattle* is an anthem for the Seattle hip hop scene, a pledge to shake up the industry, ""knock the world off its axis"" and ""motivate the masses."" Originally released in 2005, the gritty sound and solid beat of the track aim to set a backdrop for the growth of Seattle hip hop.

Fortunately she was crippled (?) so I walk faster than she run. I walked to the other side of the street and called the police while she was trying to run after me. The police arrived after 10 minutes. This happened at the Google building by the way.

I honestly just don't know what to do anymore. When I speak with the 911 dispatcher, they all seem pretty desensitized too, about how this happen all the time, and ""it's not you"" and they are affected by this every other day too. The only thing that I don't get is how are people still in denial of this, or trivialize the general safety of walking in Seattle. I wonder what does it take to change their notion.

On Tuesday the light rail was having electrical difficulties with a power outage on the north end of the line between U-District and Northgate. We were told at the stations we could ride to U-district and then transfer to a shuttle. We got as far as Capitol Hill (from downtown) before the train sat for 20 minutes and then kicked everyone off. Lots of people trying to figure out how to get home or find Ubers.

This morning, waited at the station for 20 - 30 minutes before being told that one train was down indefinitely, and the other would arrive ""at some point"", and would get us as far as U-District before we would have to switch (I wasn't sure if they meant trains or to a bus). This time it was reportedly due to mechanical issues with the trains.

Is something going on with the trains? Or is it just bad luck with new things coming up twice this week? This is in addition to the elevators and both escalators now being down in University Station for quite a long time.

We've recently received bids for some major/minor additions that we're looking to do for our home and have had a few contractors and design-builds come through and provide numbers and the quotes seem to be all over the place. I’ve seen some from ($67K, $102K, 150K).

It's pretty hard to wrap my head around some of the costs so also considering DIYing this. We financially can't tackle everything on the list if going through contractors, but are also looking to get the most 'bang-for-the-buck' with our house. 

Some things about what we’re trying to do;

1. Master Bathroom/Closet Reno: We don't have a master bathroom, but are making our hallway bath into a Jack &amp; Jill 'master', along with taking an additional closet from the guest room and adding another. This would take out the current linen closet in the hallway, which without the laundry room addition, would really leave us without a dedicated space for our linens. Also would require a lot of framing/floor repair/etc.

2. Office Creation/4th bedroom: I work in our foyer currently most of the week, so it's open and noisy. I really would like to close this off and make it into an actual office/bedroom for better use and resale, since we already have a large living room. This seems like a no brainer to me, but cost wise does it make sense or should I try to DIY this?

3. Laundry Room Creation: We don't have a laundry room. Our washer/dryer are in the garage currently and we're planning on converting 1/4 of the garage into a laundry/mudroom. This would add ample closet space for our seasonal clothes to go, along with a much needed dedicated mudroom for linens, hanging wet clothes, utility sink (which we don't have), etc. roughly 12x10 space.

Anyone know of what these should cost, especially in the current market? Thanks for reading and helping with anything!

We both have job interviews lined up downtown today. We're staying in an extended stay for the time being because we wanted to explore all the different areas prior to making a decision on where to live.

My question is: what should we check out? Our budget is about $1500/mo rent. We've been thinking about Queen anne, ballard, fremont, or somewhere near the university, but I would love some insight from someone who knows the city better than I do. (We're both 22 btw)

Any chill bars, restaurants, or fun stuff to do that you guys could recommend? I'm pretty obsessed with Nirvana, so I'm excited to go to Viretta Park.

Macron called the “referendum” in the Donbas and the occupied regions of southern Ukraine a parody and cynicism. He also said that states that refuse to side with Ukraine were accomplice to the new Russian imperialism. In turn, Prime Minister of the Netherlands M. Rutte stressed that the announcement of mobilization and calls for “referendums” in Donetsk were signs of panic, and advised all Europeans to remain calm. Most European politicians agreed with him.

If you carefully listen to V. Putin's speech to the people of September 21, it becomes clear that all its content consists entirely of metaphors, figures of speech, expressive images, emotional tone and, of course, many myths. In the final analysis, there are remains only a twice (!) uttered phrase which really relates to objective reality in the last speech of the RF’s leader. It is about “over one thousand kilometers of the contact line”, which the Russian military group located in Ukraine is not able to deter due to the constant attacks by the Ukrainian army. Everything else is a set of words from a parallel, fictional reality, where “the insidious West elites have long sought to destroy great historical Russia”, and “Ukrainian neo-Nazis seized power in Kyiv in 2014 as a result of an armed coup”, after which “the West pushed the Ukrainian people to war with Russia.”

On the other hand, the leader of the Russian Federation, albeit forcedly (under the pressure of a successful Ukrainian offensive in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions), but, in fact, raised the stakes and took a line of further escalation! Now a lot will depend on the promptness of the supplies of military aid from the West for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Kremlin already loudly and publicly declares that it is at war not just with Ukraine, but with the whole NATO bloc. According to Moscow, Alliance instructors are now in every Ukrainian platoon. Although it sounds ridiculous, such rhetoric is an excuse for Russia to unleash unprecedented missile attacks on Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure. Therefore, it is necessary to intensify the supply of high-precision weapons, long-range missiles and integrated air defense systems to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

As for the Kremlin's hopes to flood the front with the corpses of its forcibly mobilized citizens, the latter began to leave en masse the Russian Federation right after the end of their president's speech. According to social networks, Russians are buying tickets to Istanbul and other Turkish cities with unprecedented excitement. In general, Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are waiting even for those fleeing from mobilization, citizens of the Russian Federation who do not have passports. At the same time, Israel, Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Serbia and 30 more states will welcome the Russians with the passport.

Woke up this morning to discover my 2003 Mazda Miata missing - currently working with the police to get formally reported - then onto insurance - but figured it was worth a post here as well.

Car was last seen in Ballard (parked on street in front of my apartment complex) at 11pm 9/20/2022 - was discovered missing at 8:30am 9/21/2022.

I’ve called Lincoln towing throughout the day to see if it had been towed/impounded - but unfortunately they have no record of it.

Currently waiting on police to swing by.

As locals, we have the right to complain and air our legitimate concerns. But I feel like this sub is so drowned in the pessimism that this place seems to run more like a complaint forum than anything. 

So what are some things you like about this godforsaken city?

As for me, I was born here, partially raised but moved around to various cities growing up. I've lived in Chicago, Phoenix, Kansas City, and have stayed temporarily in a few major Italian cities before moving back here- and I can honestly say that there is something special about Seattle. 

I genuinely love going downtown, exploring all the weird little nooks and crannies of Pike Place Market, all the dusty trinkets and the 3rd level that literally nobody seems to know about. I even heard some traditional Mongolian musicians the other day, what an unexpected treat. Taking the monorail through MoPop feels like an amusement park ride. The tourists on that things are always so hyped to be there. Around Seattle Center has this retro-futuristic vibe that I don't think any city can replicate. The SAM contains original artworks that I learned about in college, how fucking awsome is that. Walk 5 mins from the downtown, and you'll probably see a goddamn whale. A WHALE. WHALES. NYC wishes with their polluted crap of a waterfront (ignore their rare but recent sightings.) Say what you will about the Seattle freeze, but sometimes I feel that the people provide a warmth that the weather does not. And when the mountain is out, it's always bigger than you expect. 

In short, our city deserves better because it's so amazing.

&gt;These colors, lime/neon green, navy, grey and white are a dead ringer for the Seattle Seahawks team colors. They were in the Superbowl back in 2014 but lost to the Patriots.

&gt;It may be a long shot, but perhaps this was unsold &amp; unlicensed merchandise produced in anticipation of Seattle winning that game. It already has the SUPER on so maybe the manufacturer salvaged it by adding some other word (not BOWL) and adding leftover seersucker cuffs to sell in some other country. To me the shirt looks really nicely made except for those cuffs which don't even look sewed on well, probably because they're a different fabric weight.

&gt;Here is a shirt from 2013, a Super Bowl that they won. It has white lines going through grey letters. The shirt in the object photo seems to have grey letters under the top line of text and also has lines going through.

Hey everyone! I just wanted to introduce myself again. My name is George, and I am a rising junior at Stanford interested in civic engagement and politics. I started working on a project with other students that’s been totally awesome and cool. Basically, we’ve made a newsletter that summarizes the info from Seattle City Council meetings in an accessible and easy way. I have put an example from this week below, though the real thing has a bit more formatting that doesn't translate into Reddit. This project is very new, so we would really appreciate any feedback you may have! I would love to see comments and show me what I need to do to make this newsletter the best it can be. I totally recommend joining! Who doesn’t want to know what goes on behind the scenes of their own beautiful city?

I really want to move here. But my job’s hours are firmly 6AM-2PM PT. And I’m a night owl.

I’m currently at a Greenwood AirBnB doing a 2-week trial run. It’s been hard fighting my urge to stay up, but working these super-early hours hasn’t been as hard as I thought. But short-term stays are different than a permanent setup, and I want to do another trial run in a few months to see how I do with the dark and gloomy winter.

It typically takes place every Monday, at 7:30 PM at Optimism Brewing, 1158 Broadway (except for when the brewery closes for holidays, employee appreciation events, apocalyptic occurrences, etc.).

Start time is typically more like 7:15, as people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. Don't worry if you don't see any games as they'll be brought out soon enough. If you're new, I will be there with short blue/purple hair and a giant bag of games. I will also get a reservation for the group so a little placard should be out as well.

In regards to food, Optimism does not have a kitchen but does allow food from outside. They also almost always have a food truck show up every night. Food truck calendar here. We ask that you please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.

FAQ:

Q.) What kind of games are played? Should I bring mine?

A.) A whole slew of games are played; from short games like Codenames and Liars Dice, to longer ones like fresh fish and Beyond the Sun. And feel free to bring your own games, too. You might find some people who are interested in trying it out.

Q.) I don't really know how to play any board games besides x, y, z.... Will I be welcome here?

A.) That's completely fine. There are plenty of people who are willing to explain the rules and do quite a good job at it, too.

Q.) Speaking of being welcome, what kind of people are allowed to attend?
A.) Everyone is welcome, so long as you are polite, respectful, and considerate of the other patrons. Also know that Optimism is a dog friendly bar, so bring your pup if you'd like. And if you're allergic, be sure to take any medicine before attending.

Q.) I don't drink alcohol, but want to be supportive of Optimism. How can I still be a good patron?

A.) Optimism also sells a non alcoholic $1 bubbly, crisp, sparkling water that I have enjoyed before. And if you can't handle any sort of carbonation, then there's no need to buy anything. You can support Optimism in another ways: telling your friends about the venue, grabbing and bussing any glasses someone may have left behind at another table while on your way out, etc.

Q.) There's another huge board game group there... are you a part of them?

A.) Nope! That is the Seattle Gaymers group. They're super organized, have a Facebook group, and even have a welcoming table. However, there have been times when someone from their group has mingled with ours and that's been fine.

The friends I do have are just not in the position to help me unfortunately and family is non existent 

I do work I’m currently waiting for a background check to go though for Old Navy and I DoorDash almost everyday and that’s a huge reason I’m so low on gas. I have money waiting for me in my DoorDash account but unfortunately I have to wait till Wednesday for the direct deposit to hit

Last night, my fiance and I parked our car at Cedar Crossing Apartments. When we entered the garage, it was open with a sign indicating that it was open for public parking with a 2-hour maximum. 

Great. We park, grab a coffee and come back 30-40 min later only to find that the garage door is closed. One of the residents kindly let us into the garage and we were able to get to our car. We attempt to drive out of the garage only to discover that the garage door is locked and broken. Over the course of the next 2 hours, 6+ residents are trying to get in and out but none of their controllers or FOBs are working. We call the property management line 4 times only to be told 3 different things. 1st call: A technician will be there within the hour to fix the garage door. 2nd call: We'll call you back when the technician gets back to us (no call) 3rd call: We're tracking down the technician now. They also let us know that other residents have called in about this door so ""they're working on it"". 

At this point, my fiance has called every number available on the lot. The emergency line (re-directed to the management team), Bellwether Housing (again, re-directed to Cedar Crossing), the towing company, the direct line to the company that installed the garage doors. We live 40 minutes from Seattle so we're just wanting to get home now. We even escalate to calling 911 to see if we can get someone to help. 

2 1/2 to 3 hours go by and we call the property management line one last time (4th call). And they finally let us know that there is no way for the technician to get there tonight and we'll have to wait until the morning. Didn't even call us to let us know, despite us leaving our contact info with them.

The resident who let us in checked in on us every 20-30 min and kept making sure we were okay. What a champ. 

6 pm rolls around and we surrender to the fact that we need to leave our car in this garage overnight. The resident lets us out of the building and we take an hour bus ride home. 

Fast forward a bit: It is now 2pm the following day. We call Cedar Apartments first thing in the morning and they have no answers about the garage door. Call again in the afternoon with no update. Again, they took down my fiance's contact info so they could call back once the door has been fixed. 

We both work, so it's not like we can go down to Seattle and wait around all day. Given that we've called every number connected to this company possible with no answers. We will be heading down after work to see if we can access our car again, but I guess the real questions are:

1. Is there any kind of number we can to either make some more noise about this? 
2. Legally, can we do something about this?

Is there anywhere between here and Tukwila (Renton maybe) that has a casual (but not bar setting),  delicious menu?

Both of us are willing to travel anywhere between Tukwila and Issaquah as well as meet up in downtown Seattle. And we both love just good food regardless of the setting as long as it’s not loud because we need to talk.

I discovered a small booklet on the side of the Road. I first thought, oh shit, wallet.

But Picking it up it was infact a VISA and Passport for a young lady from Columbia.

Now it's moving week up here and by the age and so I'm assuming this is just a student who had a little too much on their hands probably. 

Point being. I'd love it if she can get this back. There's a ton of personal information in here. Stuff an evil person could use wrongly.

I can't seem to find a Columbian embassy, I don't know if calling UW can help In any way.  I'm unsure of where the closest transplant safe passport service is that takes foreign passports.

So ATM my only choice seemingly is find this person or destroy it so no awful bastard can use it.

So If you think you know her or are her please send me a Message with the full name. The First name is **Maria**. I'm not giving this back to any middle man so it needs to go directly to her. I will shred this long before I let anyone else at it.

Friends all over the Duwamish Peninsula heard it. Dogs were barking. 

The West Seattle Bridge was re-opening, **but the noise was not related to that**.

I heard later that someone had **a giant personal fireworks show off a barge in Bainbridge Island.** I can't imagine how big and loud it was that it was heard all over West Seattle. That has never happened before.

This giant fireworks show was morally irresponsible. The fact that it wasn't publicized ahead of time was inconsiderate. It scared people and animals, polluted the air and surrounding water, and was a frivolous waste of money when some people don't even have a place to sleep at night.

My hope is that these folks see this post and dig a little deeper into their heart next time, maybe they can find a way to celebrate that lifts the entire community in a lasting and meaningful way.  If they have benefitted financially from their family or business, maybe they can find a way to give back. We are all learning. I wish them the best and a chance to redeem themselves.

[The Material](https://www.wearethematerial.com/) is a San Diego area pop punk group noted for their introspective lyrics and lead singer Colleen D'Agostino's powerful but raspy voice. *Moving to Seattle* is one of their earliest songs, from their 2007 debut EP, *Tomorrow*. The song doesn't explicitly mention Seattle, but describes a coming metaphorical rainstorm that forces the singer out of their rut and towards realizing their dreams. In this way, Seattle is romanticized as an artistic and inspirational city.

Then you have towns like Kenmore and Edmonds that already have older downtowns, but are clearly working on making them more vibrant and appealing (Edmonds more so than Kenmore, but still).

Then I look at cities like Shoreline and Lake Forest Park.

Shoreline has a few tiny business districts: yes there are some newer developments in North City, and yes there are plans underway for an urban village in Westminster Triangle. But still, it seems extremely underwhelming, especially given that Shoreline is the largest of the suburbs.

I recently fled a domestic violence situation with nothing more than the clothes on my back. My toddler and I bounced around couch surfing for...a while. I finally have found some people willing to let me live with them in exchange for labor and as I finally have a place to stay for more than a week I am trying to make life a little less hectic for my toddler and I. I have a little money but we are stretching it as far as we can. I am taking all the right steps and trying to get into the right places but don't want to get into where I am on that for privacy reasons. I have called anywhere I can think of looking for help and hitting dead ends with DV shelters and any other normal assistance. They just don't have things or are overwhelmed and can't offer assistance. I don't know Seattle very well as I have only lived here a short time and I am limited by the bus system (which is pretty great but that is to say I don't have a car). If you know of anywhere that could help me get the following items for cheap or free I would be so grateful.

He is 1.5 yrs old and 40 lbs.
The things I am trying to get ahold of are: 

A stroller so I can walk to places like the library to do job searching or just get out and walk so we are not cooped up all day.

A car seat so when a friend is able to take me on errands I can bring the child.

A crib (and sheets for a crib) so he has a bed that is not mine to sleep on. 

A high chair so I can contain the mess to one location when I feed him.

Socks, and cold weather gear in preparation for winter. Jackets, Pants, shoes, socks, hats, gloves, etc. or even just a few changes in clothes.  

If anyone has unopen teething rings, he is about to start teething and I have nothing to help him with it. 

Diapers and things of that nature are always welcome as well though the other items would add a level of sanity to his and my life.

If you have had a toddler and you look at this list and go ""Oh, you will also need X"" and can point me to where I can find one or you have one I can have then please DM on reddit. (Author here: I will pass on any contact information or anything else if you want to DM it to me.)

We are near N65 st for reference.

I haven’t been to Seattle/the rest of Washington since 2019. ALL cities have rough areas and it’s usually pretty clear to just simply stay away from those parts. But since then it seems that homelessness, drug use, poverty, and crime has spread into all areas of the city and other parts of the state. It goes without saying that Tacoma was downright scary in some parts, but even towns like Port Angeles had a lot more people strung out on drugs and TONS of run down houses all over. A lot of cute shops and boutiques seem to have all shut down too. I hardly saw any families either! 

I have always dreamed of living in Washington and took another trip to consider this as an option again, but now I don’t even know if I would come on a travel nursing contract.

But with few major events in Seattle area this weekend, this is as good a time as any, so if you need to travel through there, HEADS UP:   
• I-405 will be FULLY CLOSED from 11 p.m. Friday to 10 p.m. Saturday – 23 hours – at Exit 9 (112th Ave SE/Lake Washington Blvd SE) – for emergency repairs. Drivers will use the Exit 9 ramp to detour around the closure and flaggers will be directing traffic but it’s going to be slow-going through there so add lots of extra time and be safe around the flaggers.  
• Revive I-5 is happening again, but this time only the off-ramp to Columbian Way/Spokane Street and right lane near there will be closed, and for a shorter time. Lanes will be reduced from 7:30 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Sunday, but we'll be out of there by the time Seattle DOT has its much-anticipated reopening of the West Seattle Bridge Sunday morning.  
• Also note that the I-90 bridge bike/pedestrian path will be closed this weekend as part of an expansion joint project.

So in particular on Saturday, if you’re going southbound, it’s going to be slow-going. If you can go through very early (like before 10 a.m.) or late, or consider using SR 99 (but remember, that includes the tunnel toll), that is going to be your best bet. If you’re going to the big Husky football game, consider using transit if possible and plan to head out to the stadium earlier than you might normally.

I’m in need of a bit of advice from the wisdom of the group here. I’ve never been to Seattle before or PNW and have a work trip beginning on Wednesday at the end of September. I decided to take days off on Monday/Tuesday and will be flying in from the northeast, arriving at Seatac at 11am on Saturday. Here’s where I could use some help. I like outdoors but have only done just some preliminary research. Wanted to see if people thought this type of itinerary seemed doable. Does this make sense to rent a car for \~3 days to go to Mt. Rainer Park and stay in Ashford? Then drive back to Seatac, head to Seattle Monday evening?

Saturday: Arrive at Seatac 11am. Hopefully get out of airport with rental car just after noon. Assuming I stop for lunch/hiking foodstuffs, and it takes 2hrs to drive into Mt. Rainer, that gets me there around 3pm if not a bit later. I read arriving after 2:30pm is a good time to avoid peak traffic in the park and get parking, ect. Maybe I am able to spend 3hrs inside that afternoon? I’d plan to be staying somewhere in Ashford for ease/proximity to the park. Or is there something better, more worthwhile along the way Southbound where I could maximize time vs. feeling like I need to enter Mt. Rainer on the first day? Or no, just do that initial plan?

Sunday: get up early, leave ashford and drive into park for a full day. 

Monday: Same thing, spend better part of the day in the park. Was thinking leave around 2:30pm-3:30pm to drive back to seatac to drop off rental. I still need to figure out where to stay in Seattle (open to advice there too – I like good food, beers/breweries, ect. doesn’t need to be fancy at all.) So, if realistically checked in around 5-6pm, probably not going explore too much, but rather head out to an area for food and drink. 

Tuesday: explore Seattle! I would be checking in at my work-related hotel that evening in the downtown area. Then work/real life begins Wednesday.

So, does that rough plan seem reasonable? In theory that is 2.5 days in Mt. Rainer, then an evening and a full day somewhere in Seattle. Would love to hear from others if i'm completely overlooking something or should reconsider some aspect, ect.

We like to go when there's light traffic because our bigger dog can resource guard a bit. We stay further back from people and she just catches the ball over and over while the other one runs around and plays with the other dogs. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few areas where the river is accessible on one side of the dog park. There were two women that were walking with 3 toddlers, strollers, and a labradoodle near the water. He was working on confidence with the big dog because she's afraid to grab the ball too close to the water. The doodle came over and the big dog gave off Go Away signals, which the doodle was happy enough to understand and went to go smell/play with the other dog. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my experience, when another dog is sending off leave me a alone signals, dog owners will be like 'yea, okay, let's go play with someone else' and keep moving. Instead, these women park their strollers, pull out their phones and keep their dog close to big dog - the body language was that they were clearly waiting and actively trying to instigate an incident. They were so consumed with keeping their phones trained on our big dog, that they don't even notice when one of their toddlers falls down and almost ends up in the water. SO sees what's happening and recognizes their shady behavior and starts to get VERY pissed that they're clearly neglecting the kids that are with them (unsure if babysitters or parents). He grabs big dog's ball and calls for little dog so they can start walking further down the path. These women choose that exact moment to then start walking again, keeping pace with him. He turns around to make eye contact so that they know he can see what they're doing, and they start pretending to take a picture of a tree. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my **question** is, has anyone else had this happen at Marymoor before? We have gone a hundred times without any sort of incident like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, if these are your babysitters - fire them. They don't care about the kids.

&amp;#x200B;

**For clarification:** 

\*Big dog is not aggressive, we just like to be cautious and pay attention to dog body language

\*SO is a Latine man, the women were East Asian 

\*Labradoodle is golden

\*If this was somehow a coincidence, it is the Biggest coincidence because their phones for almost ten minutes were directed ON our dogs and on him - not the scenery OR the children

With those dear children, the myth of the lynchpin officer died in Uvalde. By the doctrine of The Thin Blue Line, police require broad discretion on use-of-force decisions. This is because officers hold the line between order and chaos. Improperly restrained and police may fail – in which case something terrible could happen.   

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

A grand jury has been assembled in Denver after police shot six innocent bystanders in a failed attempt to kill a man who’d surrendered.   

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

The Thin Blue Line has come to represent a distinct ideology widely adopted by police throughout the US. This is clearly an extremist ideology, though its simple propositions guide the organization, training and professional conduct of law enforcement organizations nationwide. This is a problem that requires immediate attention and forceful action. Because police officers employed to protect and serve, it turns out, conduct themselves quite differently than officers employed as lynchpins against ""chaos."" The defund slogan got as far as it did, let’s be honest, because it doesn’t appear that our standing army of lynchpin officers is willing to stand under a banner of service through sacrifice – at least not by any standard view of what sacrifice might entail.   

We expect police to accept risk on our behalf, that’s the job, I think we all agree on that at face value. Yet, through aggressive union representation and by the blessing of an apparently drunken judiciary, police have foisted the dangers of policing onto the public to the point that the most obvious sacrifice involved with the vocation is carrying the emotional costs of committing horrific acts of violence. Prolific cop trainer, “Killology” author and blue line devotee Dave Grossman speaks to this directly.

The following quotes Grossman in a video titled, “The Police Trainer Who Teaches Cops to Kill | The New Yorker,” which is available on youtube. “Are you emotionally, spiritually, psychologically prepared to snuff out a human life in defense of innocent lives? If you can’t make that decision, you need to find another job….Do you understand you could be sued for not shooting? Stand there and do nothing while people are murdered, what do they call that? Cowardice, malfeasance, dereliction of duty….Don’t be afraid to get sued, everybody gets sued, just a chance for overtime. Be afraid of being sued successfully.”

I didn’t have to go cherry picking for that quote or misrepresent the context to cast a shadow over policing – it was plainly said. The blue line ideology is literally reducible to “shoot first ask questions later” without a hint of dishonesty or bad faith. And the further you dig into the source of that quote or the culture he’s informed, the more obvious it becomes that the decision to shoot 6 innocent bystanders in Denver was made in a classroom. In this classroom, pupils were taught to recognize split second decision making as cause to shoot - which is far different than training to make the right split second decision and then fostering a culture that enforces expectations of accuracy. Nonetheless, it will likely be decried as cherry picking to suggest that the argument for restricting police use of force is six times stronger than arguments in favor of officer discretion, given what happened in Denver. But that strength differential is not for the simple fact that Denver police shot six innocent people in a failed attempt to kill a man who’d surrendered. No, it’s because police authorities in Denver, like everywhere else in this nation, won’t straightaway condemn such acts or the mindset and training that delivered such results – because they’re blue line extremists willing to trade the well being of 6 innocent bystanders for phantoms of faith.

**A simple value proposition**

The blue line proposes to maximize public safety through the surgical application of necessary violence. A police force that worships of violence of action is a bargain for public safety, the faith maintains, so beneficial that its value is not diminished by distasteful appearances. Like when police training materials in Louisiana were found to quote Hitler more than any other source, for instance. Because public safety is maximized when police are endowed with broad discretion on use-of-force decisions – as the many units of “chaos” held back by police violence effectively offsets the public safety costs of six innocent bystanders being shot, for example. It’s our fault, I suppose, for not demanding that these phantom public safety gains be demonstrated more clearly. Because, clearly, a thousand people shot dead by police each year nationwide is too high a bar. And that’s not to mention all those unnecessarily brutalized, harassed or disrespected in nonlethal police encounters. Given that policing isn’t, in fact, particularly dangerous, it seems wise to ask: for whom is blue line policing a bargain?

A popular counterpoint to this anti-police rhetoric is that only a small percentage of police encounters become violent. Therefore, it’s held, claims of rampant police violence are unfounded. But if this is true then shouldn’t we also recognize that, by the numbers, which are overwhelmingly clear, policing causes far more physical harm to innocent citizens than to police officers themselves, and that the greatest threat to officer safety is their culture of impunity? And that, therefore, the flagship content of blue line ideology is propagandist fiction? I mean, the majority of police deaths are traffic related, which is probably not unrelated to the fact that so many police refuse to buckle up – though they’ll write you a ticket for doing the same. Similarly, the 55% spike in police deaths from 2020 to 2021 is attributable to COVID related deaths, which is probably not unrelated to the fact that so many police refused to wear masks – even when mandated by laws they enforced against others. It shouldn’t be controversial to recognize that, by the numbers, the value propositions of the blue line simply do not add up.

**A derelict judiciary**

But what about the fact that so many police killings, a clear majority, are ruled “justified?” That kind of shoots a hole in the reasoning above, doesn’t it? No – twist – actually, it doesn’t. Instead, it’s simply a testament to how extreme policing has been allowed to become. This is thanks to the persistent and growing dereliction of our judiciary. Blue line extremism grew into what it is today in the shadow of a series of absurd legal delusions. Without such cover, the blue line would have surely been cleansed by the light of day.   

**Qualified immunity**

The “court created doctrine” of qualified immunity is likely the most notorious legal delusion of them all. This doctrine holds that police are immune from civil liability except where it can be shown that an officer has violated an individual’s “clearly established rights.” While lay people such as myself widely regard our first and fourth amendment rights as pretty fucking clearly established, that is not how this works. The test for whether or not an officer has violated clearly established rights comes down to whether or not the officer “reasonably” knew their actions would violate an individual’s rights.   

In Texas in 2020, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it wasn’t reasonable to expect a corrections officer to understand that an unprovoked pepper spray attack against an inmate would violate his rights, because the case cited by the plaintiff to demonstrate a clearly established right concerned prison guards beating and tasing inmates – not pepper spraying them. In essence, qualified immunity invokes the irrelevant to practically guarantee officers freedom from civil liability and it turns the concept of reasonableness into a brazen display of unlikely ignorance. And better still, since it was ruled that unprovoked pepper spray attacks against inmates warrant qualified immunity, the right to be free from such attacks by demented prison guards has become clearly unestablished.

**GrahamVConnor - 1989**

A similar perversion of reasonableness is found in the 1989 supreme court ruling GrahamVConnor. The court confirmed in Graham that excessive force claims against police should be evaluated with respect to the “objective reasonableness” standard of the 4th Amendment. This test considers the severity of the suspect’s alleged crime, the threat level posed by the suspect and whether or not the suspect is resisting or evading. But, and here’s the kicker, those factors must be considered with respect for the fact that officers may be compelled to engage in split second decision making and “from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight."" So, in practice, the “objective” reasonableness test dictated in Graham boils down to asking officers accused of excessive force whether or not they’re guilty. Because what cop would testify to perceptions that would cast their use of force in an “unreasonable” light? The result of this standard is that trigger-happy rambo cops have become the template for what passes as a “reasonable officer.”

**A special bill of rights and police unions**

Finally, we have the “Officer’s Bill of Rights” and the contractual legal favors achieved by police union negotiations. These vary from state to state and from one police department to the next but in either case they often afford police due process rights beyond those available to ordinary citizens accused of crimes. Police unions argue that these are necessary to protect police from overzealous prosecutors and internal affairs. But it’s far easier to find hundreds of examples of these protecting police from warranted accountability – see Freddy Gray, for example – than it is to find even a single case of a police officer being victimized by a bad faith prosecution. Police are rarely charged, much less prosecuted, for abuses that are clearly unreasonable and unjustified by any standard definition of those terms. Furthermore, special favors written into the law strike against the legitimacy of our entire legal system, given that legal authority in the US uniquely depends on the rule of law, which basically holds that the law should be enforced equally against all, according to the internet.

**The Thin Blue Line is an extremist totem that should be abolished without a second thought**

US police are now firmly established at the intersection of Derelict Judiciary and Blue Line Extremism, which I hope I’ve shown is a real and distinct ideological force inside our police departments. At this place in policing, officers can proudly provide perimeter security for a terrorist as he murders children, while beating up any parent who tries to intervene, or they can bravely unleash a hail of gunfire into a crowd on a Sunday night. There appears to be no limit to this absurdity, really, as the aforementioned examples were not enough to compel forceful change. The faith maintains against distasteful appearances. And the police stand ready to beat back any forceful objection.   

We marched for change in 2020 and the police beat us then. We would have held them accountable for that but in Seattle they covered their badge numbers with a blue line. The chief, a snake, assured us that this had nothing to do with individual officers avoiding accountability for the skulls they cracked during Seattle’s infamous Summer of Love and everything to do with honoring fallen officers. Though apostates contend that, with that blue line over their badge, Seattle police shamelessly exploited the death of officers unaffiliated with the department to evade accountability while it simply abused the community – for no other obvious reason than to retain its impunity. Because police in Seattle didn’t beat up too many rioters, as any FOX News report from that time will confirm, but they did consistently target press, protest medics and constitutionally protected protesters.   

So as the mythical lynchpin carries on past Uvalde like some kind of headless chicken, I hope we can finally **recognize the ability to reinforce as the true foundation of robust public safety.** We don’t need rambo cops if we have officers who view sacrifice as more of a willingness to face mortal danger, and risk dying, than a capacity for violence, and risk killing unnecessarily. With brave cops, restrained from preemptive violence and backed by sophisticated reinforcement capabilities – which, as it happens, we already have – there’s no threat we cannot overcome.

	With those dear children, the myth of the lynchpin officer died in Uvalde. By the doctrine of The Thin Blue Line, police require broad discretion on use-of-force decisions. This is because officers hold the line between order and chaos. Improperly restrained and police may fail – in which case something terrible could happen.  

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	A grand jury has been assembled in Denver after police shot six innocent bystanders in a failed attempt to kill a man who’d surrendered.  

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Thin Blue Line has come to represent a distinct ideology widely adopted by police throughout the US. This is clearly an extremist ideology hiding in plain sight, though its simple propositions guide the organization, training and professional conduct of law enforcement organizations nationwide. This is a problem that requires immediate attention and forceful action. Because police officers employed to protect and serve, it turns out, conduct themselves quite differently than officers employed as lynchpins against ""chaos."" The defund slogan got as far as it did, let’s be honest, because it doesn’t appear that our standing army of lynchpin officers is willing to stand under a banner of service through sacrifice – at least not by any standard view of what sacrifice might entail.  

	We expect police to accept risk on our behalf, that’s the job, I think we all agree on that at face value. Yet, through aggressive union representation and by the blessing of an apparently drunken judiciary, police have foisted the dangers of policing onto the public to the point that the most obvious sacrifice involved with the vocation is carrying the emotional costs of committing horrific acts of violence. Prolific cop trainer, “Killology” author and blue line devotee Dave Grossman speaks to this directly.

	The following quotes Grossman in a video titled, “The Police Trainer Who Teaches Cops to Kill | The New Yorker,” which is available on youtube. “Are you emotionally, spiritually, psychologically prepared to snuff out a human life in defense of innocent lives? If you can’t make that decision, you need to find another job….Do you understand you could be sued for not shooting? Stand there and do nothing while people are murdered, what do they call that? Cowardice, malfeasance, dereliction of duty….Don’t be afraid to get sued, everybody gets sued, just a chance for overtime. Be afraid of being sued successfully.”

	I didn’t have to go cherry picking for that quote or misrepresent the context to cast a shadow over policing – it was plainly said. The blue line ideology is literally reducible to “shoot first ask questions later” without a hint of dishonesty or bad faith. And the further you dig into the source of that quote or the culture he’s informed, the more obvious it becomes that the decision to shoot 6 innocent bystanders in Denver was made in a classroom. In this classroom, pupils were taught to recognize split second decision making as cause to shoot - which is far different than training to make the right split second decision and then fostering a culture that enforces expectations of accuracy.

I have lived in the county for about a decade and have never received one. I know why however. 

My carrier is T-Mobile and they sold my browsing data to King County. How do I know this? My internet provider is in my spouse's name so I can rule them out. My carrier is T-Mobile who fucked up the spelling of my name (unique factor 1) and gave me a different middle name(unique factor 2) when I moved to them 5 years ago.The store rep made the mistake when I gave her my license to copy from. This misspelling is very niche of a common name too. I've lived with it as it was a fun way to see who they sell my information to.

 Originally I thought T-Mobile was using a basic demographics profile to sell information like age, sex, plan type, and so on from the types of mail I would get. The main was basically targeted to poor people (not saying I'm rich, but payday advances type of stuff).

Well in the past month I read a post here or in the other local subreddit about animal shelters being full, due to people giving up pets they adopted during the pandemic. 
 I went on a research tangent about how to help whether it be donating, volunteering, fostering or maybe adopting. I try to understand everything I would sign up for if I went through the fostering route. My search history was heavy on how to care for pets, average cost of supplies, care regimens the whole nine yards. I had been on mobile data, during some of these searches, when commuting on transit to work 2 hours round trip per day. I did not have my VPN enabled during these searches at the time either.

Low and behold I get one of these letters in the mail after a month of heavy searching. I'm thinking T-Mobile is using a geo fence and targeting key words of users then sells that to the county. I contacted King County Animal Services when the letter came. They confirmed they purchase mailing lists, but did not confirm what parameters or who they purchase them from. Then I was told they routinely send them out to everybody in the county. I told them if it's routine to send out these notices why is this the first time in 10 years of living here I am getting one? Why hadn't my spouse who's lived here longer never received one? They backpedaled and said it may have been coincidence. They said it's not a waste of money and that those letters help fund them. I never once implied it was a waste of funds during the call. I approached the call with the nice dumb confused person aesthetic. It is ironic that the money wasting defense came up without any prompting on my end.

I want to see if others have experienced this, or would like to try and trigger this out of curiosity.  Quite frankly it's turned me off to supporting them.

Details below:

- I work as a designer at a consulting company which also has an office in DT Seattle. I’d keep working there for a year to establish residency and hopefully get instate tuition to go through the MDes program at UW. Any tips for being a grad student at UW?

- We we’re looking into the Ballard/Fremont area. We have three dogs and would like to rent a home/townhouse with access to grass for the pups. How early should we start looking next year? In Austin you sign a lease like 2 weeks before you move in. 

- My boyfriend is big into hiking, camping, running, and cycling. Any trail/path recommendations there?

- I bowl on an amateur league, are there are good bowling alleys with leagues in the area?

- Also, yes, we are aware there is a homelessness problem, but so is there in Austin.

- I have several mental health disorders, does the seasonal depression hit different if you already have some issues?

I got a statement for hundreds of dollars worth of fees to clean and paint my apartment. However, they provided no reasoning and a bunch of blurry images i couldn't make anything out of - I took ample photos and videos before leaving, showing the apartment in a pristine state. They even included the contact information of the debt collector they're using when sending the fee statement.

They also sent me a water utility bill for the first time in 12 months, even though water was supposed to be included in the rent. And a VCR (vacancy cost recovery) electricity utility charge to change the authorized Seattle City Light user. That one was ridiculous, because the electricity bill wasn't even in my name (it was in one of my roommate's), and my unit wasn't vacant until the day before my lease ended.

I hear horror stories like mine all the time, where people have to pay random, unreasonable/false move-out fees to predatory landlords. 

Is there anything we can do to dispute these charges? I've already reached out to both the apartment management and the 3rd party utility billing service they used to dispute but I'm not expecting anything.

The common consensus is that Seattle is supposed to have pretty strong tenant rights - does anyone know what types of rights apply to me in this situation. Is there anything I can request from the local tenant union or city government? 

For personal action, I'm thinking about charging back my credit card as the first course of action. I was also thinking about using a robolawyer (https://donotpay.com/) to produce an automated document to threaten to sue. I'm hoping they'd just let the charges go because having a lawyer review legal documents would be at least $150/hour, and even if they have a lawyer, it'd be a huge pain and take a ton of time to respond to a law suit.

*Gold Rush* was the lead single from indie rock band [Death Cab for Cutie](https://www.deathcabforcutie.com/)'s 9th studio album, *Thank You for Today*. Death Cab for Cutie was originally founded in Bellingham and this piece, released in 2018, is written about Seattle. The song's tone captures a rising tension as real estate developers clamor to dig up the city, build high rises, and resulting in a changed and unrecognizable neighborhood that no longer feels home. In an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2018/06/13/618984034/ben-gibbard-talks-about-death-cab-for-cuties-new-album-and-first-single-gold-rus), Death Cab for Cutie's front man, Ben Gibbard, describes how the song was inspired by a sense of loss and need to come to terms with walking down his old haunts in Capitol Hill and seeing the neighborhood changed.

gotta say, all this smoke and fire has me feeling a little homesick. wanted to offer some advice for those of you who might have to evacuate. 

\- bring what you need and only what you need. i know it feels like shit leaving everything behind, but it can be replaced. your life is and will always be more important than a few extra knick-knacks. what is essential is: documents, pets, at least two changes of clothes, electronics and spare chargers, and masks. do not forget medications if you have them.

\- first-aid kit. bring it. you never know when you might need it.

\- if you're caught in a smoky area, wear a mask. i know it sucks, but it's better for your lungs in the long run. bring extras and share with those who don't have them. if you've got pets with you, the best you can do is a bandanna around their neck you can continually wipe their nose with. 

\- water, water, water. cannot stress this enough. pack some bottles of water. if you've got kiddos, pack bags of goldfish and snacks. this might be something you set up in the car ahead of time if you're in a grab-and-go zone. bring water for every member of the house and pets. 

\- on the note of snacks: do not forget your pets. pack a gallon-size bag of kibble and a dog water dish. 

\- if you have time, check with elderly neighbors and larger families around you. don't leave people behind if you have the time to help. we're all in this together, folks! again, this is more of a courtesy thing, but a little bit of help can go a very, very long way if situations get tight.

• Safety / low crime

• Reasonable cost of living
• Access to airport (to visit family) 
• Close to mountains, rivers or ocean (aka the great outdoors) 
• Seasons or mild climate

After talking it over with his sibling (who is aready living with us) and a friend of ours who also really wants to move out there, they are both 110% down for moving with us whenever it happens. 

We are currently renting an apartment in Florida for $725 a month, and my husband and his sibling were originally thinking about looking for a house here in FL at the end of the year, (we all have about 80k in savings and were gonna use it for a down payment) but now that we want to move to WA, I think we will just use that money to move. 

But how feesible is it? We live all the way in Florida, and I haven’t made a cross country move before. Should we just buy a home in Washington, or rent there first? Is it possible to get a job lined up if you’re not living there yet but do have a concrete move-in date? How much money should we have in savings first before going? Also, I currently work in I.T. as a service desk analyst, but I plan to use what I learn here, get certified, and apply it to a better paying I.T. job in WA. Does anyone know if it’s hard to get a job like that out in WA? Also, what areas in Washington would you recommend living in? Our ideal would be somewhere close to Seattle, but wouldn’t mind somewhere more in the country area if need be. As long as I can see mountains, I’m happy lol. It’s also important for us to live somewhere that’s LGBTQ+ friendly, my husband and his sibling are trans and we want to find a nice, safe community.

Since my last post, problems with trash, sewage, altercations, bike/drug commerce have continued.

**First, we tried the Find It Fix It App:**
- No action on 72 hour parking enforcement or illegal encampment.
- Did get a visit from SDOT to dump chemicals on the sewage once.
- Additional requests from neighbors did nothing to help.
- Request for SCL to replace burnt out streetlights has been open for 3 months with no action.

**Next, we decided we needed to handle the mess on our own.** Trash has built up and trees are now overgrown and making the sidewalk unsafe.
- Organized a neighborhood work party.
- Was issued a temporary no parking zone permit so we can work safely.
- Rented no parking signs from National Barricade and placed on street, with permits attached.
- Called for enforcement of the no parking zone.
- SDOT Supervisor: ""If the vehicles are occupied, we need an SPD patrol officer to show up. That's up to them, so we're at their mercy. We'll see how it goes.""
- 3 requests for enforcement, zero results.

**Tried a desperate move and wrote to Councilmember Lisa Herbold.** Not expecting that to do anything, but at this point why not. 

Any other ideas?

At this point, I feel like we're out of options. I'm tired of shouldering the burden of this crisis for the rest of the city. I could do it for a while, but three years is my breaking point. 

**My advice to anyone else with an RV parking spot near your front door, drop ecology blocks before it's too late.**

If you feel that this is unfair to the unhoused people in these RVs, I agree that they need somewhere to go. DM me your address. I'll pay for the towing to get them relocated to your block. If you're in Admiral, I'll even throw in a gift card to Met Market.

We should demand departmental policies that prohibit proactive police violence and create mechanisms to fire offending officers that are without recourse and beyond the influence of SPOG. 

**Proposal**: SPD officers may not use force proactively. In the event that an officer does use force proactively and the victim of that action decides to file a claim, the validity of that force shall be judged by a ""jury"" of randomly selected Seattle citizens who hear claims from all involved. In the event the use of force is judged improper, that jury of citizens should have the power to terminate the officer's employment without the possibility of outside recourse for the officer(s) concerned. That's the pitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Justification**

**Seattle is not SPOG's hostage!** It's time we join the rest of the developed world by creating EFFECTIVE mechanisms that allow communities to purge violent criminals from their police forces. 

Policing in the US has shaped itself into paramilitary form. As citizens guaranteed the rights outlined in the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution, we have the power and the authority to purge criminals and paramilitary elements from our police departments. 

The tactics and mindset of US police are most powerfully informed by a novel vocational ideology that's ubiquitous among police across the nation. The particulars of this ideology are front and center in the writings of police consultant and [""Killology"" author Dave Grossman](https://youtu.be/PwEYhIX4cbM). This ideology is expressed through the display of ""blue line"" symbols, of which SPD is quite fond. In essence, this ideology contends that police are a righteous force holding back an otherwise imminent wave of crime through the calculated use of discretionary violence. This ideology turns officers into lynchpins against crime, where we'd surely be overrun by waves of criminal hordes were police to be restricted from the proactive use of violence. But has this ever been true? Haven't police themselves disproven the cost/benefit propositions of their own novel ideology?!

We should recognize that the myth of the lynchpin officer also died in Uvalde. This \*\*\* ideology has turned so far up its own ass that an army of police armed to the teeth couldn't be bothered save children from being slaughtered by a single untrained shooter. But in typical fashion, those police successfully beat up and threatened parents, effectively holding perimeter security for a demented terrorist. In typical fashion, those police lied about what happened after the fact. In typical fashion, the police harassed and threatened the woman who managed slip their perimeter to save her own child!!!!! **TOO FAR, THIS MUST END NOW!!!!!!!!!!** 

We saw SPD conduct itself in a manner similar as above when they sent an army to arrest the man who'd filmed them peppering spray a small child. SPD are firm subscribers of the vocational ideology that brought us Uvalde and they make proud display of the blue line symbol. The ideology behind that symbol informed SPD's deliberate decision to put the community in danger by broadcasting false information about proud boys bearing down on police brutality protesters. It informed SPD's decision to deliberately withhold services so they could lie about being barred from access to a crime scene. SPD has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to put the community at risk to achieve goals contrary to our democratic will. It's time we recognize the blue line as a terrorist symbol fostering an extremist mindset that's actively threatening the rule of law, our constitutional rights and basic human dignity by isolating police from the communities they serve. 

It's time for police to find security in the good relations they keep with the community - not in having carte blanche to use violence at will. **Because it's the ability to reinforce keeps us safe.** In any crisis, of any magnitude, the ability to reinforce is the most powerful determinate of a favorable resolution. Lynchpin rambo-cops are undependable and too costly, as has been so tragically proven time and time again. But a steady inflow of reinforcements will never fail to secure a scene. Of course, we could imagine scenarios where rambo-cops skillfully save the day. But wouldn't it be better to observe the glaring reality that rambo-cops have failed to live up to their end of the bargain? It's time to call out all the ways blue line extremism has foisted the dangers of policing from their shoulders to ours. 

Let police own the dangers of their chosen profession. Demand departmental policy requiring officers to withhold violence until a threat has been objectively proven and give a means of firing offenders that's immune to union influence. This should not be a problem for police operating in good faith, with the consent of the communities they serve.",True,False,False,Seattle,t5_2qhad,474133,public,self,Require SPD to never initiate violence and let us fire those who do - It's time for a new push!!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/xatsuf/require_spd_to_never_initiate_violence_and_let_us/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'hRTwc_VeVYyBfVSmna7uK1HErWRIWHKSbmPLKZ6pBiw', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/i7wxUZNGJTjom6xdy7G2URNhvFRiBKiGn7MnC5o64W0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=405fad353190308fd444c69abb363b8673900cc3', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/i7wxUZNGJTjom6xdy7G2URNhvFRiBKiGn7MnC5o64W0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91bc67f966ef71d28d654832328092cc469105ea', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/i7wxUZNGJTjom6xdy7G2URNhvFRiBKiGn7MnC5o64W0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cab5ecbdbccaa2ec923719dda490c345f7634bcc', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/i7wxUZNGJTjom6xdy7G2URNhvFRiBKiGn7MnC5o64W0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3a7d04a0731ef80eaea2de617a00893778d711d2', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,

## SPD Weekly Update

In their city-wide weekly report to the Council President, SPD management says Year-to-Date (YTD) Homicide events continue to be up 25%, with 40 incidents YTD compared to 32 last year. YTD Shootings &amp; Shots Fired events are up 30%, with 533 events compared to 410 events last year. Shootings are up 24%, with 149 events YTD compared to 120 the previous year. Of the 149 shootings YTD, 163 victims have been identified at the time of the event.  
 

Understanding and addressing the full scope of the recent rise of violent crimes in our city is one of my highest priorities. We will continue to provide statistical updates as they become available to our office.

Seattle's about to get a new police chief and King County a new prosecutor. Meanwhile, public sentiment regarding homelessness and crime seems likely to support a new era of aggressive policing and prosecution in Seattle. Nonetheless, it remains true that a significant portion of the local population regards SPD to be outright illegitimate for their past misconduct. 

I am in that second population. SPD, as far as I am concerned, surrendered its legitimacy when it engaged in political violence and the strategic dereliction of duty in 2020. How do you propose that SPD is fit for cause in a system where legal authority depends directly on the rule of law and democratic consent? You need to clarify.

I'm not going to deeply review items of SPD misconduct to make a case that they're unfit for cause, we're way past that, it's well documented and widely known despite apparent efforts to scrub evidence from the internet of rampant misconduct in 2020, in particular. SPD's campaign of violence was plainly demonstrated for all to see and many of us have not forgotten, nor will we ever forget. We saw, for instance, how chain of command served SPD as crime-cover more effectively than it served the public to restrain the department's unnecessarily violent and hostile posture. The entire world then saw how the OPA served SPD as an accountability shield, contrary to its ostensible function. We watched media parrot pro-police propaganda and outright lies in real time as Capital Hill was held on lock down - simply so police could assert their dominance. Furthermore, during the police riots of 2020, SPD wore blue lines over their badge numbers. And we didn't miss it when blue line flags took front and center as a violent mob swarmed our nation's capital. 

I'm not willing to entertain fictions about police that require me to ignore this obvious march towards authoritarianism. No. I was sent overseas to fight a war for freedom (which was bullshit) and I came home to find that our police had been transformed into paramilitaries who treat common citizens as enemies. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Not gonna happen. We need our leaders to be brave and to put the wayward institution of law enforcement back into its place. If you don't who will? Are you comfortable sending the message that it's up to citizens to protect themselves from ego or ideologically driven police violence? What other mechanism of protection do we have?! We need real policy solutions and effective accountability mechanism to respond to widespread, systemic police misconduct. This is more urgent than ever as police have effectively postured themselves above the law by beating back the disapproving public, without a proper response from local, state or federal officials. So far, all we've gotten from elected officials is more cover for an institution that's become overtly hostile to those it's meant to serve.

But I'm not here to offer criticisms without proposing solutions. There is one simple thing that could be done with great effect. Mayor, you have the power to implement this proposal as departmental policy. It would have far reaching implications, both practical and symbolic. You must dictate that Seattle Police shall not initiate violence without automatically placing their job at the mercy of a ""jury"" of randomly selected citizens. So, for instance, if an SPD officer shoots someone who did not initiate violence against the officer or public, that officer's job should be at the mercy of citizens assembled to either validate or reject the legitimacy of that use of force. Criminal accountability must come from elsewhere, I understand.

It's time that we dictate that police find security in the maintenance of the good relations they keep with the communities they serve. Currently, however, police find security in the ability to commit horrific acts of violence without fear of legal peril. How has this worked out, giving police carte blanche to initiate violence? It's great for officer safety, police are as well protected as any king's men have ever been. But they're just as hated. 

Furthermore, how specifically is the public served by providing police wide latitude to initiate violence? The basic argument for this approach is that public safety is best served when officers can employ violence without fear of legal peril, given that missteps may occur in high stress environments. Essentially, by this view, most notably championed by Killology author and police consultant Dave Grossman, police officers are proverbial lynchpins, holding the line against impending waves of intolerable crime with discretionary violence. But how practical and efficacious is this? Like, for instance, how'd the cost/benefit of that approach work out in Uvalde, where it's supposed to have the greatest utility possible? SPD is just as selfish and cowardly as the police are in Uvalde - we know because of how they conducted themselves in 2020. It's time to end this cruel joke.

We're getting NONE of what we paid for though we're saddled with the ever-rising costs of authoritarian police. It's time to let police own the dangers of their chosen profession. Fuck Mike Solan and his union, the city is not his hostage. Because it's not violence-enabled police that keep us safe. THE ABILITY TO REINFORCE is what keeps us safe. In any crisis, of any magnitude, timely reinforcements are the variable most influential to favorable resolution. Absolutely, we could imagine scenarios where restraining rambo-cops results in unfavorable outcomes. But outside of our imagination, in reality, rambo-cops have failed. And the policing doctrines that enable them are yoke around our neck. It's time to start acting like it. You've got options.

There’s a tree down the block from me that for the past few years has been leaning at an increasingly precarious angle, directly over several power lines. It’s a decently tall fir tree that has clearly seen better days. Not sure of the exact height, and I’m certainly no tree expert, but something about the angle the whole top half is bending at doesn’t seem healthy to me.

It’s worried me a little off and on since I’ve lived in this neighborhood, but it has definitely seemed to have gotten worse since last year and with the wind picking up, I’m a bit worried that the next major windstorm might be its last. 

Given it’s proximity to major power lines, homes, and being just a few feet from Lake City Way NE…yeah, I think if that thing comes down, it’s going to make a huge mess for North Seattle.

It seems too good to be true as [wholewashinton.org](https://wholewashington.org/how-we-pay-for-it/) mentions that just about everything would be covered for all Washington residents. As in no deductibles, premiums, out of pocket expenses, copays, out of network charges and lowered prescription costs. Here’s the proposal on covering the costs:

Employers would contribute 10.5% of wages.
Employees may contribute up to 2% of wages which would be a payroll deduction.
Sole proprietors would contribute 2% of earnings (1st $15,000 won’t be taxed)
Investors would contribute 8.5% of capital gains. 

This would make all my dreams come true and I’m sure it would relieve everyone in this state. I’ve had to put up with horrible work environments with terrible pay just so that I could have “benefits.” However, anytime I’ve had to utilize these benefits it’s always a battle to get anything covered even though I pay hundreds of dollars in premiums a month for many years for fuck all.

I also had a family member who was diagnosed with stage three cancer. However, her healthcare provider (paying $200 to $300 a month for a decade) put full brakes on in covering any further tests and treatment that were absolutely necessary to save her life. After FOUR fucking months open enrollment came around for her husbands job at Boeing and luckily they were able to cover some of it. However, she developed stage four by that point. All the while she dealt with the stress of fighting with her employer’s health insurance company and they didn’t give a shit if she died or not.

I know I’m not the only person who has an anecdote or two like this. Why the fuck do we still let greedy health insurance companies dictate what’s medically necessary while our doctors (who are physically evaluating us, not the health insurance company) are saying otherwise?

On top of that all other developed countries have long known and established similar systems. Probably because it’s a human right.

I’m pretty disappointed that our pretty liberal state isn’t catching on to this. Is there another initiative like this in the works I’m not aware of? In the meantime I’ll be volunteering to collect signatures either way. I NEED this, everyone needs this.

I was surprised this morning when Chandra called me directly and offered to discuss all my concerns. What an amazing opportunity! Luckily I was at my desk and ready to take notes. She has time for calling one constituent each day, and I was fortunate enough to be free at the time when she did call, and had already written out a lot of questions and thoughts because of the ongoing strike. We had an hour-long discussion and I asked about the strike, the teacher demands, the comprehensive school board plan details listed on the district website, etc. Hampson was super focused to get me answers and I'm thankful for her time. Below are my notes from the conversation, and I tried to leave out my own commentary or editorializing and focus on her responses (until the very end).

  
Hampson has 3 kids in the Seattle public schools, 2 of them have 504s in place, and they went to Sandpoint Elementary. As a parent she is also dealing with her kids being out of school due to the negotiations and strike. She has been in the role of teacher, parent, and now elected to the Seattle School Board.

  
Hampson wanted to clarify a couple things about roles and responsibilities of the different groups involved. As a parent I was also quite confused about what the focus and role are of the School Board and the district, compared to the teacher's union, and how each side is involved in the ongoing contract negotiations.

  
Before diving in - Hampson shared the Lighthouse study on school boards, results of which are driving how school boards are being structured around the country. It's the largest study on school board performance and is guiding our current board's methods for their own structures and policies: [https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED453172](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED453172)

  
A school board director job is entirely about governance, not customer support, meaning: they are responsible with setting the direction of the schooling, curriculum decisions, guidance towards classroom and school best practices, and ensuring that schools have resources available to execute on planned changes. In the context of the inclusivity model (more on that later) Hampson clarified the School Board's job is to provide the direction and the goals for the inclusion, clarify what is required (at federal, state levels) and what is not permitted by law. The director position is not like other elected officials because the school board is elected to represent the students first and foremost, and the community in which they live. It is ""the worst elected job"" because of how thankless their efforts are but also how impactful the decisions become. Hampson was very clear that the board ""doesn't represent teachers or parents, but instead represents the entire community when making decisions"". They have to think of what's best for the entire community in Seattle, not one specific interest group or demographic.

  
Because the directors are so focused on governance they do not have time for ""customer support"". They do often help connect parents with resources, or help solve problems at specific schools in their coverage. They're full-time focus, however, is governance and decision making. Some tactical changes are being made to address the problems around customer service. Right now the board has hired a consultancy to perform a full communications audit of the district to try and figure out where and how they can improve communications internal and external, and it's up to the superintendent to get the district staff to provide all the data and information. Additionally, the board is aware that they need to create a high-value customer service department to handle the myriad problems parents face when trying to navigate district policies and processes.

  
The community needs to understand that the only non-district entity involved is the SEA teachers union - by definition the union is created to advocate for teachers and teacher negotiation, but the district and board are created to support the students and drive student success. This may seem like semantics, but it's a very clear distinction that the SEA union is an external entity that is hired to do a job, much like an attorney is when representing clients. The union will use every tactic to get what they need for their members because that is their primary purpose for which they are hired, even if it isn't best for the students. They will use spin and stalling tactics, and others to get the agreed-upon list of demands. The union is looking at teacher advocacy, not student success. The difference can seem subtle at first glance.

  
Now to a primary sticking point of the ongoing strike and negotiations: data and real-world experiences in other districts and states show that an inclusion model will get us out of being stuck with the problems the schools face when dumping money and resources into SEL/multilingual and special ed, but not getting results or pushing the needle. Last year, the existing model used in Seattle schools poured $120M in addition to all the state funding, but the results were abysmal. Everyone, across the board, including teachers, staff, admins all believe that the goals and results of a properly-executed inclusivity program at the district level is not only achievable, but is the right path to follow. It's clear that the 1:1 model of assignment for SEL does not produce the desired (or federally mandated) results, and it just segregates students, often along demographic lines that are historically underperforming. The board believes that if we don't start with the inclusion mechanisms this year we may never catch up to the goals set by law.

  
In response to the need for the inclusivity model the SEA teachers union created a task force to come up with a plan on how to rollout and execute in the schools, and to determine which resource would be needed. The board is 100% behind the task force's plan toward inclusion, and also getting the staff the resources they need to implement it. To support the plan the School Board determined that no changes to staffing ratios will happen in the 2022/23 school year, and instead the year should be used for onboarding teachers and admins, support training, and build out curricular resources for inclusion. For this first year the School Board is asking for a 1-year contract. The plan will take 5-10 years to unwind and rebuild for full implementation, and it's clear that things will be more expensive at first before efficiencies materialize to decrease cost over a few years, and to achieve all the expected student results. The board is trying to update and modernize the practices of the district because it's clear that many students are not getting the experience and opportunities they need.

  
I asked Hampson what the role of a director is in the current strike. She believes that the board and district didn't do enough to inform teachers and parents during the pandemic that this large uplift is coming. For that reason, and others, there is a real trust gap, and also a belief gap - people don't believe that the school board is reformed in their direction and their commitment to the schools and teachers. The school board is primarily responsible for the belief gap. The last superintendent put out communications that weren't true, but the new board and district staff are committed to be ing extremely fact-based. The superintendent has been directed to focus solely on student issues.  


As a director, Hampson is staying focused on the specific goals set for the district - things that must be done or are not allowed. The board is keeping students at the center of their focus. Sometimes that means asking tough questions like ""can we afford this?"" Right now the SEA union is asking for $500M, but the planned investment in school resources is already greater than what we currently spend. No one is saying ""screw the inclusion thing"" and everyone agrees with the goals, however there is disagreement on how to get there. The current board cannot agree to things that will result in a deficit for the next board.

  
Okay, so what's the plan to get teachers and parents onboarded? Hampson has many points on what the board is doing to get us from here to there. First is addressing the big trust gap with the community. The first year of implementation is meant to be an onboarding time to work on aligning everyone on the process and goals, hence the board asking for a 1-year contract. The district will add additional staff, and provide training opportunities for teachers, admins, and staff, on how to handle the transition to the inclusivity model. Not every classroom will become an inclusion classroom. The board is also reminding everyone that change is hard, especially transitioning from Seattle ""talking progressively"" about education and inclusivity to switching into execution mode and making actual changes that implement the goals.

  
Many other tactical changes are happening. We have a brand new superintendent that is an expert in governance. The superintendent job is not like school-administration, but rather has to be someone who is an expert in governance; this encompasses an entirely different skill set than a former principle or school administrator. This is the first time that a superintendent is hired for that particular skill set, and we haven't yet had the time to see what exactly that means at the scale of SPS because of his short tenure thus far. The board is also asking the state and colleges to mandate teacher and administrator inclusivity and special ed training for all teachers graduating to work in our districts. It's not currently required and has created a huge deficit in teacher abilities in working with inclusion classrooms. The district is also buying curriculum for the first time. What that means is teachers will have curriculum that is uniform across the district, pre-made for them to use, and they will be able to train on the curriculum to avoid surprises or having to fall back to previous year's plans. The curricular support is aimed to reduce teacher burden so they can focus on classroom time more, and student interaction and not the overhead of building out curriculum. Individual plans do not scale to a system as large as SPS, and having uniformity makes for easier teacher onboarding and long-term success.  


My parting thoughts: I'm really thankful that I had the chance for a real discussion with a board member. It's not often that we can hear directly from decision makers and get responses to our questions without a news source or press release as an intermediary. It gives me validation that there are real people doing the hard work in those jobs. As a parent, Hampson knows what it's like working with the district, and going through the 504 and IEP process with her own children, and she knows the pains we feel watching these bureaucratic processes take place. Our feelings as parents and community members right now are very real, and the frustration is felt from all sides. I got the impression that Hampson and the school board are genuinely invested in the success and future of Seattle schools, students, and the community. I hope that we can all come together and collaborate for the sake of our students and for Seattle.

  
The board's comprehensive plan is available on the schools website along with the current negotiation details. Here are some other resources that Hampson shared for reading on inclusion and school board data:

There was a question and answer session with Precinct Captain I will paraphrase

What about that encampment down by my house with really bad stuff going on?

SPD doesn't handle encampments anymore there is an app for that finditfixit

People are dumping beat up cars in front of my house what can I do?

SPD doesn't do parking enforcement anymore It's now SDOT there is an app for that finditfixit

I called the  non emergency line and was on hold for 20 minutes and the call dropped WTH?

SPD doesn't run the 911 call center anymore there is not an app yet...

I live and work near Aurora and people are getting shot and killed at my bus stop and people are buying and selling drugs at 125th and 145th bus stops what can i do? 

SPD no longer enforces drug laws in North Seattle due to resource issues and you should stay off Aurora at night.

All I wanted to do was cancel my Seattle Times. Originally, I just wanted to pause it, but I realized that there was no Cancel option in

In 2022, not having a *Cancel Subscription* option in your Account information for literally any service is not any oversight - it is a purposeful decision by a company to make the customer service experience as difficult and unpleasant as possible in order to delay cancellation or to frustrate the customer into submission. This is exactly what the Seattle Times does. 

In order to cancel the a Seattle Times subscription I had to call their Customer Service number, which immediately then gives you an option to either continue the call or have it done by text. This begs the question - why not have an online text option on the actual site to begin with if customer service can be done by message? 

The first time I called, I figured I was already on the phone (annoyed), so let's just continue this route since I am already invested in it. Robo menu option kicks in (No bilingual option). Bunch of options - none of which are Cancel, have to go to next menu, still no Cancel, so you get kicked to a prompt that you will be sent to a live person (hurray). Ring. Ring. Your call is important to us, blah-blah-blah. Order in which it was received. 

**Then nothing. Dead air. Silence.** 

For three minutes the phone is sitting on the table next to me and I am looking at it suspiciously. Did it disconnect? No. The call timer is still active. It is just dead air. Three minutes of Nothing. 

I hang up (more annoyed), and let's try this all again.  

Same procedure (really annoyed) and this time, I get some 1970s smooth jazz music for approximately 15 seconds.

**Again three minutes of Nothing.** 

So this is where I know my initial gut feeling was exactly right. This sort of customer service experience is meant to beat the paying customer into submission. To make it as difficult as possible to stop taking money from them. I hate these sort of companies. My senior mother in the last few years of her life used to always accidentally get sucked into this sort of scams online. She would want to order something that sounded like something she wanted, only to accidentally get sucked into a subscription service that required sacrificing a newborn lamb at the solstice to finally be able to cancel.

Third times a charm. I am already 32 minutes into this experience. Lunch is already over, but I am stubborn. 

Call the number again. Let's try text messages now..

She claims to be a bite sports trainer (affiliated with Modern Icon K9 and Wolf Sky who stand behind her actions and are actively blocking people who message about this incident) and has been involved with a German Shepherd rescue in the past (they don't want to claim her now!). 

She was caught MACING two small dogs who were in their own yard and then when confronted she lied and said it was water (it's been confirmed that it was mace by a screen grab of the container and past comments of her saying she maces dogs)—then she doubled down, revealing the kind of human she is. She has a history of this vile behavior in the South Park neighborhood. 

[Videos of Incident](https://imgur.com/a/5GfS5Qa), and there should be a longer video attached to this post of her reaction to be confronted.

The two dogs who were maced vomited and did not look well after. The incident has been reported to the police and animal control. 

This is an example of why it's so important for people to know that the dog training field is UNREGULATED. Please don't blindly trust just anyone who says they're a dog trainer. You have to do your due diligence. Ask for official certifications!

It's been awhile since I visited Seattle properly, though 2 days ago I was on a roadtrip with my family &amp; rode the car though the I-5 highway, where I saw the Link. I will try to do a proper visit of Seattle this month, and will try out your public transit.

But my intuitive opinion is that the Link line 1 is not very well designed. The frequency is quite low; every 10 minutes at peak. It's a strange mix between a light metro (rapid transit) and a tramway. The route is mostly segregated. But it uses low-floor trams. These vehicles are more suited to cheaper ground-level routes that cross the street rather frequently. I've heard that they need to stop for longer than actual metro trains, due to fewer, slower, and flimsier doors. While I'm not against low-floor trams and light-rail transit in all cases, I think a major dense city like Seattle should have an actual metro line.

If it turns out that Seattleites are actually really proud of Link Light Rail, I apologize for this entire post.

I consider the Skytrain to be a major pride-point for Metro Vancouver. It's a fully automated light metro system with world-class frequency. It comes once every 100 seconds at peak times, and every 3 minutes in off-peak hours. This is cutting edge. The first line opened in 1985. It costs less than a conventional metro, but still has a high overall capacity due to the large number of trains. The Expo &amp; Millenium lines are 36.4 &amp; 25.5 km long, compared to Link line 1 being 40 km long.

There's also the Canada line, which serves the airport. But I'm excluding this one when talking about the Skytrain, as the Canada line uses different incompatible rolling stock.

I would think that the people at Sound Transit would be familiar with the Vancouver Skytrain, and would know all these things. It's not like they would have to look very far.

Link line 1 &amp; the Expo line Skytrain both have stations spaced roughly 1.6 km apart. The Expo line has an average speed of 49 km/h, while Link line 1 is 42 km/h. Not as much difference as I thought.

So I'm interested in knowing whether you would want Seattle to have a metro based on the Vancouver Skytrain; using Bombardier/Alstom Innovia rolling stock, like the Expo &amp; Millenium lines. We can imagine a Seattle system having a lower frequency than the Vancouver Skytrain on opening; maybe once every 4 minutes at rush hour and every 5-6 minutes most of the day. But it can be increased as ridership grows. Because they are automated, the system should be fully segregated. Those two Skytrain lines use linear induction motors with a central induction rail, but Innovia trains are also offered with conventional motors. The linear induction motors allow them to climb steeper grades.

1. Do you think that Link line 1 could have, and should have, been built as a fully segregated light metro? Would you have preferred a Skytrain-like system over the one you got? Do you think it would have had much higher ridership this way?
2. Do you think such a system should be seriously considered for a new line? I don't know enough about Seattle to know where to put it, but probably a major commuting route that enters downtown. If it's another North-South line, it may benefit from wider spacing than the Link line 1 &amp; Vancouver Skytrain.
3. Would you go as far as to say that replacing the current Link line with such a system would be worth it? I would be inclined to say no, as there are probably more cost-effective upgrades that would require fewer changes to existing infrastructure. But I'm still curious to know.

Huge brown circles covering the ceiling, active water leaking down when the person above me showers, and the ceiling and walls actually crumbling down. This is so unsanitary. Not to mention there is a major ant infestation I cannot get on top of. 

Also the back door lock is broken so people who don’t live in the building come in and break into cars in the garage. This is so unsafe, I’m sure you can imagine the type of people walking right into our building right off Broadway in Cap Hill by Safeway. How do I get the landlords attention?? I have complained to the city via a web form. I’m guessing everyone in the building is keeping mum because they are content to pay super cheat rent for a condemnable building.

I know I am somewhat biased towards teachers for this, but the communication I have received seems outrageous. Is this normal - to receive such one-sided information, where none of SEA’s actual issues &amp; concerns are actually addressed?

Specifically, at least from my POV - the two main issues seems to be about the removal of classroom size limits in special education (as compared to the last contract)…they are literally just removing classroom caps. And secondly, about dictating when teachers can use personal time off - limiting it on days next to weekends and holidays.

None of the emails address these two concerns and paint a picture of “teachers who are going to strike, yet again, for more money….but don’t worry, SPS is here to bargain and will be the adults in the room”. The teacher union was ready to come to the bargaining table this Saturday as Sunday, and SPS cancelled 8 minutes before the meeting was scheduled to begin…

Again, from my POV - teachers are sick of this. They don’t want to have to use a strike as a tool for negotiation, but are left with no viable options..especially with the not too distant thought of something similar happening to librarians and nurses in years past, and now most librarians have to split their time between multiple schools, and same with nurses.

Thanks for coming to my Talk - grab your teacher a gift card to a local coffee shop if you can, but above all - show them empathy and compassion, they work so hard!

We’re staying downtown and I know it’s pretty quiet where our hotel is, but we’ll take public transport or rent a bike share to get places. Are there electric mopeds to rent in Seattle? Should we download any apps in advance?

Is there a preferred method of travel? (I assume the bus) If so, is there an ORCA Card equivalent I should pick up?

On The Daily podcast, they talked about a physician in vancouver who prescribed fentanyl to addicted people. This has financial backing from the government I believe. It's part of a belief of harm reduction where the idea is that addicts are harmed by getting poor quality drugs on the street and are ODing because of high tolerance. If the idea is to reduce the number of OD deaths from opioids, lets regulate and control fentanyl and give pharmapseutical grade fentanyl to the addicts under the supervision of a doctor/nurse. The idea is also that addicts, when they don't get a hit, go through withdrawal which is extremely painful. To avoid this pain, addicts always focus on getting the next hit. Thus, if we provide a place where they can do that, they will have some stability in their life and will then focus on stabilizing other parts of their life like their housing and employment situations.

The doctor did not seem to really mention anything about them getting clean, but rather that if they keep coming to the doctor's office for fentanyl, knowing they will always be able to get their fix, then maybe in the future they will ween off it or take less.

The podcast guest mentioned there is no clear evidence that this has been helpful or therapuetic in any way because the program is so new, and it doesn't get much funding from the total federal budget. However, there is a similar program down the street from this clinic for heroin, and apparently there is more positive evidence that this regulation of heroin has actually allowed users to stabilize their life (again, this doesn't necessarily mean getting clean).

I regularly get a morning Americano at one of our many fine coffee shops and I love it when there's a thick, greasy crema floating on top. It makes my morning.

It used to be that I could count on Vivace to always have that crema, kind of my gold standard, but lots of other places did it too. And in general I would usually have something very tasty. 

Lately, this seems to be happening less often. In fact, sometimes I've been getting bland, watery coffee and it's been like a 2 months since I had that crema.  It's mostly still pretty good coffee, but it's seldom great.  This is at the same spots I've been going to forever... Vivace, Ladro, Broadcast, Victrola, Anchorhead, etc. There's a new barista at one of these places where I get basically hot, brown water. This is what got me thinking and triggered this post.

What gives?  Is it bad luck, the hot weather, supply chain, or staffing/pay/cost of living issues? Am I too spoiled, or maybe my taste buds are out of whack (though I'm not seeing the crema, either)? Maybe global warming is affecting the beans/fruit, or the stars are out of alignment?

Where should I go to reliably get my fix?

You will have a choice between Approval voting (Approval top two runoff voting, or Approval runoff) and Ranked Choice Voting (Instant Runoff Voting).

I will present my arguments for supporting Approval runoff voting:

Approval runoff voting is better than RCV, because it performs better than RCV, in selecting the Condorcet winners. Condorcet winner is a candidate, who would win against every other candidate in head to head election. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet\_winner\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion)

Election simulations conclude that Approval runoff performs way better that RCV at selecting the best candidate, the Condorcet winner. Source: [https://www.equal.vote/science](https://www.equal.vote/science)

Second argument, voting honestly under RCV can backfire for voters. If you vote honestly under RCV, it can lead to the election of the your least liked candidate. Example, [recent Alaska 2022 special election under RCV.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndFPTP/comments/x4mk4t/2022_alaskas_special_election_is_a_perfect/) 

Thankfully for the Democrats, it worked in favor of them, even if voters preferred a moderate republican. But for every situation like this, there can well be an opposite situation, where Republican can get elected under RCV, even if voters preferred a moderate democrat.

I am concerned that he has been discriminated against for being Autistic and intellectually disabled. There are many things that have happened throughout this experience that makes me feel this way that I won't get into, but the most recent issue is that they are now saying they do not want to approve him for long term maintenance treatment even though they have been saying that he would most likely need it his whole life. They cannot seem to explain why the change even though the treatment has clearly helped him and may have even saved his life (he was severely malnourished when he entered the hospital due to not wanting to eat or drink which is a symptom of the catatonia). 

FYI, because he can't make his own medical decisions, the law requires that the hospital  approve his treatment to continue in an outpatient setting, so it's not like we can just take him somewhere else once they discharge hum. That's why it's such a big deal that they are now saying they won't approve it long term.

So anyways, I would like to start collecting testimonials about the treatment that both disabled and non-disabled people have received for catatonia at that hospital. My hope is that there will be enough testimony that I can build a case that he is being discriminated against if it continues to look like that's what's happening.

I'm open and interested in other experiences with catatonia treatment in the area as well because it's really hard to find information on it, particularly pertaining to autistic catatonia.

Also, if you have tips for how to go about filing a complaint/ how to handle mistreatment of patients, please let me know. My family has been in a difficult position of being afraid to complain and fearing medical retaliation because we are so desperate for help and harborview seems to be our only option.

Have a ticket for the game on 9/5.

This is how I usually do it in NYC and Chicago.  But I'm not familiar enough with Seattle to know where to look (I'm new to the PNW--from Arkansas, Go Travelers!).

Requirements:  Relatively safe property-wise; an area with 2-3 star hotels (don't mind an interstate hotel swarm), a hotel shuttle that can take me to the train or near enough to walk.  

I'll be coming from Hwy 20 from the north but I don't mind going anywhere, so long as it's safe-ish for my stuff.  The game is at 3:40 and I am an early riser so I have most of the day to get in place.

I wanted to make it work, but by the end of it, I think I might have been losing my mind. I lived in NY and LA before Seattle. Those cities are grinds but I still had a positive experience. There's something about Seattle that is deceiving and that makes it a difficult place to live. It’s almost too idealistic and that’s it problem. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you get over it?

I found the most difficulty with the people, the freeze, the tech culture, the cost of living, and the politics. Yes, SAD also got to me as well. 

Bit of a background, but optional to read it:
When I first moved to Seattle it was the beginning of summer and I thought I found my Shangri-La. Beautiful scenery, progressive/open-minded mentality, and walkable, and creative amenities to name a few. Especially moving via LA it felt so much more accessible at the time. 

Over my tenure there I felt I was living in a small town bubble. I first lived in Capitol Hill and then moved to LQA after my place got broken into while I was in my bedroom. I lived in LQA for a year and moved back to CH because it felt isolated living there. No one in CH would come down to LQA. I was even told I was committing social suicide when I was moving there. It was so strange because it wasn’t at all far. It would not have been an issue in the other cities I lived. I started to get sick of seeing the same faces after moving back to CH.

I made a lot of acquaintances there but no true friendships. Ironically, everyone knew my business. Quickly too. I got involved in a couple of scenes based on my interests but it felt worst than LA when it came to authenticity. People I met were thinking “what do you have that could benefit me”. It’s Seattle, what ladder are they trying to climb? This also ties into the Seattleites' delusional thinking that Seattle is at the same tier as NY, or better or ahead of the rest of the country. It’s not.

The people I would meet all had the same linear social and political perspective and would cancel you out if you had the slightest difference in your view. Which doesn’t seem that open-minded. Additionally, they all mostly came from the same backgrounds but were hung up on identity politics. Every other person identified as “queer” or “gender nonconforming”. Which I found to be a lot of BS because they used it as an excuse to be exclusive. For example, I would go to an event and there would be some ridiculous mission statement about creating a safe space for marginalized people and a set of rules to follow, but everyone there was white or asian and they all knew each other. So who was this for?? They wouldn’t even go to certain bars because the crowd was deemed too straight. It’s freaking progressive Seattle, it’s not a real issue! So because of this, I felt I got confined to certain venues in the city. It shouldn’t have stopped me from going to other places but I was hungry for making friendships. 

I worked for a tech company and hated the culture and the antisocial workforce associated with it. What made it more frustrating is that tech is all over Seattle and a large portion(if not the majority) works in tech. If you didn’t work in tech you worked in service and hated tech people. That put me in an uncomfortable position because my job isn’t my identity but people were ready to judge me. At the same time, I empathized because the quirky artistic side of Seattle was getting erased by the raising costs due to tech which made it harder for creatives to stay there. The city felt so homogenous for that reason. 

Toward the end of living there the friends, I thought I made used me and weren’t there when things started getting rough for me at work. My job was getting psychologically toxic and I started getting deep into depression.  I tried for other jobs outside of tech but those companies couldn’t pay what I needed to afford Seattle. I wasn’t getting support or empathy from these “friends” and I wasn’t sure why. They all preached hippie dippy cosmic connections and helping people out but couldn’t demonstrate it at that moment. 

Ironically when I was living there I watched Wild Wild Country and I could help relate to it. I felt like was living in a cult and needed to escape. I did leave Seattle. Where I live now I have friends from different work backgrounds and none of us care about what we do for a living. We can have discussions, debates, and disagreements in our POV but it doesn’t affect the friendship or how we feel about each other. I’m in a better place work-wise. I also go to whatever place I want to go to without judgment. 

With that said, I’ve been thinking a lot about Seattle lately. I feel disappointed and hurt by it. I am trying to let go but it keeps haunting me. For example, things pop up on social media reminding me of people in Seattle that hurt me. More recently I came across journal entries from that time and they were painful to read because I didn’t recognize myself in those entries and I was embarrassed. I wasn’t giving myself enough self-love during that difficult time.",True,False,False,Seattle,t5_2qhad,473039,public,self,I think I have PTSD from living in Seattle,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/x3ssx1/i_think_i_have_ptsd_from_living_in_seattle/,all_ads,6,flair,8e17612a-59fe-11e8-bb72-0eebcf11070a,Rant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anyway, before closing, the buyer asked if we wanted to close early. Of course we did! But we had already rented the movers for a few days after the new proposed closing date. The buyer wanted to CHARGE US RENT to stay those extra few days that we were doing THEM a favor. Needless to say, we did not close early.

I should have realized then that we were dealing with a turd human.

I got a hotel in downtown. Obviously Ubering from Seatak will be pricy as with any rideshare from airports in general. Saw that there's a lightrail system with a stop at the airport. I was thinking of catching the lightrail and riding it all the way to the last stop, which at late hours would be the Stadium Stop.

I expect to probably catch the 12:30 or 12:45 train depending on luggage and also to account for being lost in the airport lmao. So if I choose to go, it seems like I'll arrive at the stop around 1-1:30am.

I'm currently residing in the Bay Area, so I've had experience with our lightrail system here (BART) and know how vigilant you should be. I'm unfamiliar with the area and lightrail system here. I was wondering if it's dangerous this late at night on the train (especially carrying luggage alone). Moreso, is the area around Stadium Stop safe? Is there a safer stop I should get off at?

2) Dating - Seattle has been ranked as the worst city for men in America when it comes to dating. So to the gentleman on this sub, how much do you agree with this statement? Or is it yet again, another exaggeration?

3) Homelessness - How big of an issue is it? Homeless in NYC are usually just a minor nuisance in most (not all) neighbourhoods. Heard the very opposite for Seattle.

* *If a dog is leashed there is no problem with them being in any outdoor area*. I admit I have brought my dog on hiking trails&amp;beaches where dogs are forbidden. I understand the argument proponents of such bans cite environmental impact, but I have yet to see a study supporting this claim. I would be shocked if the environmental impact of a leashed dog is anything but negligible compared to its human counter part. I doubt the ""leashed-dogs allowed"" beaches I have been too are ecologically inferior to those where dogs are not allowed at all. It blows my mind seeing surfers, divers, and fishermen off the coast of La Push, but dogs are not allowed because it would hurt the beach?? 
* *Dogs are not a significant health risk in any setting.* I don't bring my dog in restaurant because I don't want to deal with that, however, there are no real health risks from a dog being inside of restaurant. Even if a visibly unhealthy dog licks your burger, you would have a greater chance of getting sick by a healthy looking human sitting two tables away. Illnesses transferring across species is incredibly rare.
* *Deal with unruly dogs/owners on a case-by-case basis.* It really grinds my gears when Redditors back up general claims with anecdotal stories. I.e. ""It pisses me off when I see dogs on the beach. Yesterday, an unleashed Pitbull was out on the beach and bit a child!"" - like yes, obviously that dog should be put-down and owner banned, however, that doesn't support the general claim that all dogs should be banned from said beach. The same goes for coffee shops, parks, trails, etc. If a dog is being unruly, then remove them and the owner. 
* *The majority of dog parks are not sufficient.* The dog parks in Seattle are often 10x20 foot areas with gravel. This is not sufficient for a dog to run around in and play fetch. It is also quite unsanitary. I don't let my dog off-leash in parks, but I can empathize with some of those who do because dog parks are such shit holes.

To keep it short and not trying to bash him, he is a good person who can be sweet &amp; super generous—-but we are just not compatible. 

I cannot breakup with him in person. I will be calling him about it. What do I say? What is the best way to go about it? My plan is to text him “hey can you call me? We need to talk. I think we should break up.”

I am so afraid to be alone with my own thoughts and be lonely. I am so afraid that I’m gonna miss waking up/sleeping with someone I love. I am so afraid of loosing sooo much.

Rolled through for my local coffee stand for a quick coffee on my way out of town.

It caught me off guard, and when I asked ""stressful afternoon huh?"" she replied ""well, it's 4:55 and I close at 5, so if that's 'stressful' I don't know what to tell you."" 

I said nothing, and a few minutes later she said ""Can I ask you a question? What do you get out of asking me that? Do you think that's appropriate for a MAN to ask?"" Confused, I explained to her that I asked because I was trying to understand why she had been so rude when I hadn't even opened my mouth (even though she had just finished a friendly conversation with the woman ahead of me, no problem), and that as a customer I had been made to feel like I was somehow ""in the way,"" when I was just trying to get a cup of coffee.

I tried to figure out what the actual problem was, and it was never actually clear. She eventually closed the window in my face, repeating twice more that she didn't have to stand there and listen to ""a MAN.""

I'm wondering what the safest way is to navigate the Burke Gilman ""missing link"" in Ballard. I *love* biking and am fairly experienced, but I'm also pretty timid around traffic after being involved in an awful accident years ago. I might be overthinking this, but after my bad experience, I'm wary of entering fast moving traffic on a narrow two-lane road like Shilshole, and I'm trying to understand the route as best as possible before going through it in person.

(I'm aware of all the history and drama around this section of the trail, and I'm looking for practical advice rather than a rehash of all the construction debate.)

Is the best route to go down Shilshole? If so, do you take the lane all the way or during certain sections? Ballard Ave seems safer in some ways, especially after the updates in recent years, but then when you're headed east, you'd have to turn left onto Shilshole, which seems like a nightmare during rush hour. Is there anything else I should be aware of before biking this route? (Already aware of the train tracks and the need to cross perpendicular.)

[Queensrÿche](http://www.queensrycheofficial.com/) is a successful heavy and progressive metal band that has been nominated for 3 Grammy awards and sold over 20 million albums worldwide. Founded in Bellevue in 1980, they're noted as bringing complex musical structures and narratively driven albums that helped [define the then nascent progressive metal genre](https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwZcZ2X5ToC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;vq=queensryche&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). *Jet City Woman* is their ode to Seattle and describes a longing for a lover from the Jet City that endures despite time and distance.

We're seeking out PC gamers/players who either already enjoy, or are at least interested in trying out:   
1. Project Zomboid   
2. 7 Days to Die   
3. DayZ   


ALSO  
Some of us are wanting to get some D&amp;D campaigns going! Even myself, who hasn't really had much of an interest in tabletop RPGs is kind of interested in it now, mostly because I enjoy the company of those who are encouraging me to participate so - even if I'm not big into D&amp;D, I'm definitely all about hanging out with good company.   


As far as the D&amp;D campaign is concerned, most of us are on the south end of the city (Rainier Beach, Othello, Columbia City, Tukwila, Renton, those areas) and would love to find more on this side of town who would be interested in getting something going. I \*just\* got a channel set up for this purpose on our Discord server.   


For the PC Gamers who like the zombie survival/crafting aspect, we're wanting to just keep things ""Puget Sound"" oriented, so even if you're as far away as Vancouver or Olympia and beyond, we're basically just seeking out folks in Western Washington, B.C., and our neighbors down in Oregon as well.   
(Note: We're happy to include your friends/family who live outside of the area, so long as at least one of you are sort of an 'anchor' to the area)   


As with the previous gaming communities we've made, we still do IRL gatherings at conventions such as PAX and ECCC where we usually will go as a group, and we sometimes just get together for some beers and tacos on the hill or downtown just because!   


Friendly and open to all races, genders, sexual orientations, etc. - the only people we discriminate against are assholes :) Leave a comment if you'd like a link to the Discord where we're organizing from! Have a great weekend, Seattle!

Posted this on next door as well but I appreciate Reddit’s ability to cast a wide net. 

Wondering if anyone knows of any families in the Seattle or even if there is a school that need boys/mens clothing? Completely free. Can be anonymous if anyone would want their privacy for needing it as well. I live in Capitol Hill and work out by the airport if that helps. 

I am getting rid of a lot of clothing since I moved to Seattle and I’d love to provide them to a family in need rather than donating them to goodwill or something (making that family purchase them rather than be given them). 

Please note: This is not me saying I won’t donate to a place like goodwill but I wanted to first see if there was anyone who maybe couldn’t pay those prices or have that as an option. 

Clothing includes:
Mens shirts (size small/medium)
Mens jeans (waist: 30 or 32 length: 30 or 32)
Socks 
Pajama pants (sizes small/medium)
Miscellaneous (crewneck sweatshirts/wind breakers etc…. All size small or medium) 

*possibly some shoes, sizes both 8.5 and 10.5 

Clothing is good quality and not ripped/torn/stained. Comes from a non-smoking household.

For reference:

https://news.yahoo.com/buying-heat-pump-could-thousands-190922213.html

Will this have ANY effect on Democrat run cities which are typically the richest areas in the country?

Consider the following:

1.	A city like Seattle DESPERATELY needs to upgrade infrastructure for combating heat. But houses here are worth nearly a million even 30 minutes out - very few people are going to be under the income requirements to get any benefit. The people who really need something like a heat pump live in condos and apartments and as far as I can tell, multi unit dwellings GET NO REBATES. Condos and apartments in Seattle cannot install window ACs so they’re stuck with energy guzzling, expensive, and inefficient portable ACs which are running 24/7 for 3 months out of the year.
2.	There’s rebates for buying an electric car, but the region is committed to the light rail, there won’t be enough of a supply available until the program ends in 2031, and again the people who most need to make the switch won’t have the money to do so unless one of the major carmakers makes a cheap car that costs $30k or less because the people who qualify for the rebate can’t afford them. The Model 3 is the closest contender but car manufacturers have raised their prices in response to the rebate.

I could keep going.

I can’t actually find one rebate that will improve the life of anyone in Seattle except a very small minority who own houses but have low income (basically temporarily embarrassed millionaires).

Did the Democrats really just sponsor and push through a bill that will only actually help the Republican parts of the country which have cheap houses and low income?

But I guess when you have people snatching units sight un-seen a whole *month* before, there really isn't a big incentive for landlords to arrange tours. 

Anyway, like I said on top, I know there's a lot of factors at play and reasons this happens, but it just makes the whole apartment hunting process *so much more* depressing. As if the prices, day 1 applications, tons of shitty landlords and cookie-cutter-poorly-built-apartments weren't bad enough, you now have to gamble a month ahead of time...

What can they do to mitigate spiders indoors? Just a regular home defense spray sold at Home Depot, diatomaceous, or hire an exterminator? I don’t know how options differ in the PNW area and was hoping you kind people could help me help them feel more comfortable in this situation.

• Another weekend of Revive I-5 expansion joint replacement. From 7:30 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday, southbound I-5 between I-90 and the West Seattle Bridge will be down to one lane. The I-90 ramps to southbound I-5 will be open and the express lanes will be northbound all weekend.  
• The SR 520 bridge will be FULLY CLOSED from 11 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday as we install girders on the Montlake Lid and realign the highway. The bicycle/pedestrian trail across Lake Washington will be open.  
• From 7 a.m. Saturday until Thursday, Sept. 1, SR 164 will be FULLY CLOSED between SE 400th St. and 212th Ave. to finish fish passage work. Detours will be in place - passenger vehicles using SE 400th to 212th Ave, freight using SE 400th to SR 169 - and there will be some local access for residents and businesses.

Expect significant congestion on alternate routes like I-405, I-90 and SR 99. Consider transit if you can, or time your travel for really early or late. Please be patient and stay alert for road workers. We want everyone to have a safe weekend.

But I'm staying at emergency shelters so I'm needing a car asap. The plan was to go back to Texas after working here two weeks but cars in Texas are expensive and I'm actually really liking Seattle and thinking to stay until end of year. Is there any way to register a car here without a WA license? I'm looking to vote in Texas in November and for other reasons, I need to maintain an address there in Texas. I haven't decided if I will relocate here after I'm on my feet but for example tomorrow I have a job in isaqiuah which requires a 2h30 minutes walk or me pay lyft both ways and job is only 5 hours so having a car will be helpful and allow to me get more contracts and not walk so much.

I'm driving up from Portland to visit North Cascades National Park during labor day weekend and wanted to get some tips for my trip from those that have been there before. Could anyone please help me?

1) Camping - It looks like a lot of campsites that used to be drive-up (based on an old book I have) are now booked via reservation. Are there still a number of drive-up camp sites in the park, and do they go quickly? I would realistically make it there around 5 PM at the earliest on Friday, so I know that would be kind of late to snag a camp site unless it's not that busy.

2) Hiking - Are there any hikes you'd recommend as essential to someone visiting for their first time? My girlfriend and I have no trouble hiking 6+ miles with elevation, as long as the view at the top is worth it! Something along the lines of Mount Storm King in Olympic NP would be awesome.

3) Driving/Sight-seeing - Are there any areas of the park that you'd recommend to drive to? Something like Hurricane Ridge in Olympic. 

4) General Tips - Is there anything else to know about this NP before I come visit? Things like there not being many gas stations past a certain one, or good spots to eat, etc. 

I appreciate all your help! I know a lot of this stuff is on Google too, but I'm hoping my fellow Seattle redditors will be able to give me some awesome knowledge.

* The environment matters to me. I recently visited PNW Fitness on Broadway and that got to be the most blandest gym I've ever seen. It's also above a food store. It smells like a food store in there. I moved here from Minneapolis and that town has a gym called Los Campeones. I frequent two sites under that company. One building is painted all black with cool paint art like Hulk, shredded America flag, gladiators, motivational quips/quotes, etc. The other building is in an old bricked warehouse. Those environment really pumps me up compared to, for example, LA Fitness with the ugly 90s deco.

So long as either the described elevator and/or escalator are not working, I'm pretty much stuck having to Uber home. I use a cane and my walking distance is limited -- the University Street Station is pretty much as far as I can go without ending up in agony.

Interview with Collin Barret, who camped overnight to see Lebron James and Jason Tatum in a unique small venue at the Seattle Crawsover Pro-Am

Jamal Crawford is a Seattle hero who actively tries to build up the city of Seattle, and he put Seattle in the spoight as he helped bring in NBA legend LeBron James. 

Chaos broke loose as the doors opened and people rushed to enter the free event. The actual game was cancelled in the 2nd quarter, as player safety was a concern with heat and condensation on the floors.

100s of people camped out overnight and Collin shares his experience.


Interview with Collin begins around minute 14:

1. The city is farther north than I realized, more north than any big American city, which makes the winter unusually long and dark. Not that I'm complaining somehow it still manages to feel cozy

2. Everything closes so early and people talk about 11:30pm like it’s late night. I spent much of my life in Dubai. everything there is open late at night so this is new territory!

3. All the little cozy bookstores and coffee shops. My favorite little gem is Open Books as a huge poetry nerd it hits the spot! Could spend hours there. (I have a little romantic dream of falling in love with a boy there).

4. People love hiking! I'm more of an indoors person but I love how much people enjoy the outdoors here. That said there's a little trail called the Maple Valley Gnome Trail just outside the city that I love.

Greetings Transit Board and Decision Makers:

I am writing to urge the Sound Transit Board to NOT build a Transit hub in the CID - Chinatown/International District.  My objections are based upon; (list any or all;)

\-  Great loss of CID businesses and jobs 

\-  6 to 10 years of continuous, disruptive construction that will kill CID businesses.

\-  Health and safety issues impacting residents, workers, and visitors

\-  Destruction of historic and cultural buildings

\-  Loss of cultural, historic, economic, artistic activities and practices

\-  Erosion of ethnic/culturally based community/neighborhood

\-  (Your own statement)

I urge you to identify and study the other alternatives.

Most sincerely, (your name)

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your support in helping the CID to survive!  Thank you!

Best,

Before I start I want to acknowledge that this question is going to come off as obnoxious and annoying to a lot of people. I apologize in advance. 

I moved here recently and was excited to explore the coffee scene here, but I've run into a bit of an issue. 

Almost every coffee shop I've gone to has a very old-school approach to roasting and serving coffee. What I mean is the coffee beans are really heavily roasted, focus too much on Arabica vs robust, most coffees I've had are super bitter instead of sweet &amp; acidic,  and bags of coffee almost never have a roast date.

I'm looking for a true third wave roaster or at least a shop that focuses more on premium coffees from single estates and has tasting notes, the process for the coffee (washed, bourbon, honey etc.) &amp; doesn't mess around with roast level. 

I'd love to find a local roaster that offers pour overs - preferably with different options like v60, chemex, origami etc. 

I've been here for a month and gone to a different place almost every day. The only place that has something close to what I'm looking for is Root in Ballard, but they don't roast their own beans. I would love to support a business that is 100% local - besides importing the coffee itself of course. 

Here are some examples from other places of the types of shops I'm looking for:

Kind of a complex story, but I live in North Capitol Hill in a small condo complex next door to a lot that is now under construction. There is a concrete retaining wall distinctly on (my) property that sits between my condo building and the development next door. The previous developer that owned the lot had plans submitted and approved by the city to develop an apartment complex. That developer wanted to remove the retaining wall so his excavators could more easily get in and out of the site. That developer negotiated a temporary easement with the board of my condo to remove the retaining wall.  That easement was relied upon to have the plans approved by the city. The easement was filed, but included a clause which automatically terminated the easement after a certain date (sometime in 2018). The easement has since automatically expired and we were never paid for the easement. 

Fast forward to this year, the previous developer never build on the property and instead sold the property and approved plans to a new developer. The new developer has come in and rapidly started building. Our board then reached out to this developer to inform him of the expired easement and propose several solutions, including a reinstatement of the easement (with payment, of course), or alternatively, to leave our retaining wall be (which would require a resubmission of his plans to the city without the easement). He initially seemed receptive to this plan, but has since ignored every subsequent request for his response. 

Unfortunately, it has progressed in that he has now actually damaged the wall and is currently using it for anchors for his tie backs for the frames of the walls. Someone from our building went out to speak with him last weekend and he then started insisting that the wall was ""encroaching"" on his property (untrue). 

My question is, beyond notifying the city inspector, any suggestions about how to inform the city and.... prevent him from further damaging our property? Obviously retaining a lawyer is an option, but I'd really love to avoid litigation if at all possible. Anyone have any ideas?

My wife and I just moved to the edge of Mt. Baker right near Rainier ave. We were initially so damn excited for this neighborhood and buying our first place (townhome) after saving for so long. Somehow, between seeing the place multiple times and even being here for the inspection, we failed to (hear) realize it's directly under one of the busiest flight paths in the whole city. There are planes of all sizes flying overhead most hours of the day. Starts as early as 6am and goes until well after we are trying to fall asleep. All day, most days, one plane after the other. Nonstop. Some days it's clearly a landing path, and other days like today it seems to be that every single plane that takes off from Seatac flies overhead and curves around Franklin HS. I see and hear about 5 planes per minute here, it's bonkers. 

Now here's the issue - I understand the neighborhood is just really noisy, and if we have windows open it's just part of the deal of living in the city. BUT it's just as loud indoors. We have all our windows and doors shut, and there isn't a single quiet corner of our whole house. The plane noise sounds just as loud inside as it is outside. I was just trying to get a little rest at 7pm, all windows shut, and I even put closed ear headphones on with music and I still hear a plane every few seconds whirring by like every single plane taking off today is flying right through my house. Earplugs in, still hear nothing but planes. What's going on here? How do you guys cope with this, for those of you who live in a similar situation? I can't hear my own thoughts in my own home. We asked our neighbors, they said ""oh we don't really hear it, it's just a low sound sometimes that doesn't bother us"". I'm literally going insane and we've been here only a couple of weeks. It's so bad we are sadly asking our mortgage lender how quickly we can put it back on the market to get the hell out of here, losing our minds. I've lived in all kinds of ridiculous places in Seattle the last 10 years, none were this intolerable. I don't know how we got duped when shopping around, it's like there was a plot to let us in just during brief periods when planes weren't flying??

We will hopefully have an acoustician consultant that we can't afford come out for a consultation soon. I'm expecting him to tell us we're \*&amp;kced and that's that. Or encourage us to get insulation in the walls that's going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars we don't have. Please people of Seattle, I need your help we're getting desperate. I'm totally over the heartbreak and grief of realizing we made a huge mistake, and now just desparate for solutions to regain my sanity. Tried loud box fans, white noise machine, headphones, earplugs, tried punching myself in the head really hard many times, primal screams. Nothing is helping. 

P.S. I already have lots of judgments and shame about myself whining about ""boo hoo too noisy of a townhome"" I know there are many who have it much worse - and I'm still asking for help because we are at the end of our ropes here with how chronic and noisy it is and how living here has narrowed our life into one of constant frustration. \*\*\*whirrrr airplane noise right in my kitchen loud as hell as I finish writing this\*\*\* please help!!!

If we go SoCal route, we would start in Los Angeles, probably spend a day at Disney, hit up Palm Springs, Joshua Tree National Park, and then head down to San Diego and maybe drive East to Phoenix.

That day came and went with not a peep from Pottery Barn or from their last mile vendor, Ryder. Over the past 3 weeks I've called Ryder no fewer than 10 times and been told that the couch is ""lost on the dock"" and that someone at the warehouse will call me within 24-48 hours to update me. I have never once received a call. I've also called Pottery Barn who told me that I can request a refund or get a replacement made, which will likely take upwards of 8 weeks.

My idea here isn't that whatsoever. Instead, it's to preserve, protect and hopefully the language and culture of the Coastal Salish tribes of the region: Lushootseed.

I find that admitting these people were once here at the start of meetings rings rather hollow when these people's cultures have been effectively neutered to the detriment of the region. So why not work on reviving and revitalizing their language since we admit that what we have done in the past is wrong? There's evidence that this sort of language revitalization has worked in other nations, including Ireland and more particularly New Zealand, where Maori is making a major comeback.

Making Lushootseed an official language also wouldn't affect the day to day lives of people who don't care that much either. Sure, government vehicles and signs might now also have words that someone might not understand, but it would still have English there as well for the simple fact that English is the most understood language in the city. Meetings would still be in English, but government documents would be preserved in English and Lushootseed. People could file paperwork in Lushootseed if they chose to. It would effectively allow tribes like the Duwamish to preserve their culture and heritage internally without having to worry about the local city government subtly forcing them to abandon it.

To those that are really jaded about it, it could also be a boon to tourism. Imagine being the only city to be able to claim having an Indigenous language as it's official language. The promotion of Native American culture would certainly attract people who want to see something different while remaining in America, and the extra income could be used to help with city issues and continued promotion and protection of local tribes.

Lastly and certainly not least, it would be the ethical decision to make. The fact this city is named after a man with a Lushootseed name isn't working on protecting and preserving the language feels wrong on so many levels.

It typically takes place every Monday, at 7:30 PM at [Optimism Brewing](https://optimismbrewing.com/), 1158 Broadway (except for when the brewery closes for holidays, employee appreciation events, apocalyptic occurrences, etc.).

Start time is typically more like 7:15, as people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. Don't worry if you don't see any games as they'll be brought out soon enough. If you're new, I typically am there in a bright red Seattle Humane shirt as most of the time I'll be coming straight from my volunteer shift (although this isn't always the case). I will also get a reservation for the group so a little placard should be out as well.

In regards to food, Optimism does not have a kitchen but does allow food from outside. They also almost always have a food truck show up every night. [Food truck calendar here](https://optimismbrewing.com/food-trucks). *We ask that you please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ:

Q.) *What kind of games are played? Should I bring mine?*

A.) A whole slew of games are played; from short games like Codenames and Liars Dice, to longer ones like Evolution and Scythe. And feel free to bring your own games, too. You might find some people who are interested in trying it out.

Q.) *I don't really know how to play any board games besides x, y, z.... Will I be welcome here?*

A.) That's completely fine. There are plenty of people who are willing to explain the rules and do quite a good job at it, too.

Q.) *Speaking of being welcome, what kind of people are allowed to attend?*

A.) Everyone is welcome, so long as you are polite, respectful, and considerate of the other patrons. Also know that Optimism is a dog friendly bar, so bring your pup if you'd like. And if you're allergic, be sure to take any medicine before attending.

Q.) *I don't drink alcohol, but want to be supportive of Optimism. How can I still be a good patron?*

A.) Optimism also sells a non alcoholic $1 bubbly, crisp, sparkling water that I have enjoyed before. And if you can't handle any sort of carbonation, then there's no need to buy anything. You can support Optimism in another ways: telling your friends about the venue, grabbing and bussing any glasses someone may have left behind at another table while on your way out, etc.

Q.) *There's another huge board game group there... are you a part of them?*

Rather than the shed sized tiny homes, these seem to be small 2 story units, maybe 800sqft total each? And there seem to be a couple bigger buildings on site, maybe some shared resources? I don't know if it's low-income housing or some sort of cohousing/ecovillage type thing, but it got me thinking.

Can someone explain why a lot of the strategy around low-income housing in Seattle seems to focus on tiny houses rather than larger structures? Wouldn't building large buildings be a lot more efficient per unit, both in terms of materials and the efficiency of heating/cooling/utilities/etc? Build a hyper-insulated shell with lots of units, central HVAC/water/sewer/garbage/internet/power, solar panels on top, gardens around the outside, etc. The tiny-homes use more materials, require all their own less efficient infrastructure, will use more power to heat/cool, etc.

Here are some guesses/questions

* stigma around ""projects"" or soviet-style blocks
* initial cost (still, this is ""robbing peter to pay paul"", ""penny wise, pound foolish"")
* legacy zoning limitations
* politics: time to build support for and implement getting things built
* weird hangups about each housing unit having their own infrastructure(water heater, hvac, etc) rather than a shared setup (liability, HOA problems, etc) (still, you could do it with individual heat pumps and heat pump water heaters and it would still be a win)

We know from the numbers that we are so short on units that the only way to build the amount we need in the coming years is going to be huge projects. I don't see that happening with tinyhomes or developer hand-outs ""in exchange for zoning approval, 5% of the units will be below market-rate"" kind of stuff. So if that's obvious to me, an armchair urban planner, then my logical conclusion is that those in charge of these things DGAF.

I’m 25, veteran, no license and get nervous/anxious to drive. 

I’ve driven around parking lots and just felt very out of place I guess you could say. 
I get nervous about whether I’m too close on the right side, too wide of turns, maintaining speed limit while being aware of surroundings outside of car, etc. 

It’s crazy to me because I’ve never been one to get visibly scared or nervous and I’ve never been one to shy away from jumping head on into something very new to me, but with driving I get nervous and almost get a little shaky and just don’t want to do it. 

My VA therapist says since I only started feeling this way after I came home from a deployment that it could be a sign of a kind of unaware form of PTSD from an incident while deployed. It makes sense to me, but at the same time it kind of doesn’t. I think I’m more so just still extremely shocked that I am having serious trouble with this. 

I’ve tried to talk to driving schools about adult training, but they all tell me their schools are for teens and that I would have to book many hourly classes back to back to try and learn that way, only problem is I just can’t afford to pay hundreds (in most cases over a thousand) of dollars to book these classes. 

So my question is does anybody have any advice or ideas of what I can do to get more comfortable with the idea of driving? 
I know, I’ll only learn by doing, but I need more detail than that.

A friend who lives in a leafy neighborhood called Victory Heights knows I hang out on this sub, and sent me some pics and a clip they got from neighbors who plan to see if they can get the city to issue a stop work order on some tree clearing. I'm curious - is this clear-cutting thing routine? Any single-family homeowners care to chime in ?

Yesterday a tree service crew brought in equipment on a truck with taped-over plates. They cut down a bunch of mature trees and ground down the stumps on a big lot of a private home whose owner is apparently preparing to sell. The owner wanting to clear the trees suggests they are looking to appeal to a developer. I love me any and all additions to our depleted housing stock, but by the book, eh?

The workers and their boss said they didn't need a permit (though apparently if you're cutting down three or more trees with trunks just six inches or more in diameter [you definitely do](https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/permits/permits-we-issue-(a-z)/tree-removal)), and when neighbors tried to pull the tape off the truck's plate to ID them, one guy wearing a sweatshirt over his head roared up to scare them off (that's the video clip at the end). 

Neighbors contacted tree protection folks who knew this tree service, and that their MO was to come in without permits to clear large trees when the city offices are closed. Apparently a local development-finance outfit entices homeowners to let them clear the lot to maximize the sale price a developer will pay. (FWIW I looked up the tree service and it is Monroe based, has no business license to operate in Seattle, and is not registered with the Secretary of State as a corporation. Weird.)

KIRO did a story on the practice of hasty weekend unpermitted tree clearing happening in Maple Leaf recently: [https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/video-controversy-over-attempted-tree-removal-seattles-maple-leaf-neighborhood/0edee220-bf30-48ff-a1c9-ae029dacfefb/](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/video-controversy-over-attempted-tree-removal-seattles-maple-leaf-neighborhood/0edee220-bf30-48ff-a1c9-ae029dacfefb/)

The Mariners recently swept the Angels and have split their games so far with the Athletics. They have a good chance to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2001!

*My Oh My* is an ode to legendary Mariners' radio sportscaster [Dave Niehaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Niehaus), who was the play-by-play announcer for the team since their inaugural season in 1977 until his death in 2010. His voice was a staple of the Seattle sports scene and Macklemore describes the memory of listening to Niehaus's historical call of the Mariner's [dramatic Division Series win in 1995](https://marinersblog.mlblogs.com/classic-mariners-games-1995-alds-game-5-5d9e6fdef616) as a child. The title of this song refers to Niehaus' signature catchphrase.

We got married, got pregnant, moved to Seattle from Las Vegas without any family, had our baby, and started new jobs (well same job fields as in Vegas, but different teams/companies). It has been a whirlwind of a life thus far and it never stops changing.

We have created a small network in the Brier area. We absolutely adore our daycare. She and her staff are the grandmas and aunties that our little one is missing up here. We have a few friends and were lucky enough to find a good home to rent. Our goal was to buy a home by the end of this year, but in order to continue to attend our daycare we have to stay in the area. Unfortunately the area that we are renting is not affordable for us to buy in.... It breaks our heart. We were almost ready to lock into our rental for even longer and save up; thats when another change was thrown at us.

I was offered a different sales role that pays WAY more than my current role and gives mileage reimbursement (my current role does not). My current territory is all of Seattle and everything North (up to Bellingham). The new role would be a small bit of Seattle and EVERYTHING South (down to Centralia and all the way to Olympia and Port Angeles). The job opportunity is amazing and we think it is the best decision for our family. They want me to start end of September. That then brings us to a huge decision about where to live.

If we were to stay where we are we would continue to attend our daycare. But, I would be traveling upwards of 300-400 miles per day. And I would most likely be an absentee father during the week just because of the travel. The goal would be to save up all the money I am making and buy a house in 2 years (since starting a new job means I need 2 years of work experience to get approved for the loan).

The other option would be to find a house South of Seattle ASAP. We have explored and found some really nice homes in our price range (Puyallup and Bonney Lake are the front runners), but the daycares down there are nothing like what we found up North.

It makes for just a pretty dull experience that, in my opinion, does not live up to how much fun old-school trivia was.

I’ve been looking online and on Google maps but can’t seem to find the type of car wash I’m looking for.

The normal car wash I would go to back home was a standard machine wash. You pull up, step out of your car, the machine takes it through and does it’s thing, then one of the employees drives the car into the lot and a team of about 2 or 3 people do a quick wipe down with cloths, shine the tires, do a quick interior vacuuming and cleaning, and quickly clean the mats.

The whole process takes probably 20-30 minutes for a small sedan (what I own) and costs anywhere from $40-$60 plus a tip.

I have searched all over and there doesn’t seem to be anything like this in the area. 

I have found Brown Bear which is similar but after the car comes out of the machine, it seems I have to do all of the extra wiping down and cleaning which I am not interested in doing.

All of the “hand car wash” places seem to be auto detailing centers that are charging $100+ for an hour+ long interior and exterior clean.

So is there anything in Seattle similar to what I described in that $40-$60 price range? Or do I need to bite the bullet and pay an unnecessary amount of money for a detailing?

Would you say it's too ambitious to see North Cascade, San Juan Islands, and Olympic all in the same week (Mid October)?

The - rough draft - plan is to rent a car at SEA, spend the day, maybe the night, in Seattle before heading up to to a hotel/Airbnb near NC. After a day or so there we want check out SJI and maybe see some whales and whatnot for a day or so. After that I thought it would be cool to spend some time driving the 101 around Olympic while seeing and eating all things that are good and hopefully finding some preplanned accomodations along the route. And finally we were hoping to extend that drive all the way down the coast to Cannon Beach, maybe stopping at Portland along the way back up to Seattle.

I'm already thinking that the Oregon part of this plan is probably too much to do in one week especially since we will have our 4 year old with us, but I would love some local input on my plan if I can find it.

My issue is they will not market the place at all until it's been 'Profesionally cleaned' by their choice. The 'urgency' from the property mgmt company is just not there. I provided 3 weeks heads up (the day I got confirmation of purchase) and they just now told me cleaners will be here in 3 more weeks. They will not market until its fully cleaned either. They said I could clean but If it's not to their standard they will do the service anyways and I'm still paying for all that time anyways which they advised is not worth it.

I do cardio and eat about 2.5k-3.0k calories a day. I spend about $120-150 a week. The amount of spend lasts just enough for 7 days and sometimes I find myself going to the store during the middle of the week if I run out sooner than expected.

What I usually buy on a weekly basis:

1. Great Value Old fashioned oats (2lb container)
2. Great Value Greek Yogurt x3 (12 cup servings total) 
3. C20 Coconut Water x3
4. Tropicana orange juice (89fl oz) 
5. Crunchy peanut butter (1lb) 
6. Hass avocado (x15) 
7. Frozen asparagus (x3 bags) 
8. Frozen mixed fruit for smoothies (x1) 
9. Pre-cut Jackfruit container from Lam's Seafood (x3). I buy pre-cut because I had surgery and I'm not strong enough to cut open most hardy fruits or even some veggied. 
10. Overnight oats (x10) from Trader Joe's

Hey guys I'm planning on coming to Seattle for my girlfriends birth 26-29th. Our AirBNB is 7.5 miles or about 15-20 minute drive north of Seattle Center.


 I'm trying to figure out the pros and cons of driving and parking vs taking the bus. We Have the city pass and the harbor cruises/aquarium offer free 3 hr parking vouchers for the PPMG


PPMG is only 13$ for an early bird all day rate. Bus would be 24$ per day(3 adults) .Either way we'd be walking most of the time. 





--anyone have experience doing the all-day rates at PPMG


--should we leave the car at the Airbnb after our first night in town and bus everywhere?


--Would I be okay taking the bus going in and out of downtown? Any things I should know? 


--Parking is free on Sunday, does this make it difficult to find a spot in Downtown or woodland park/Northgate area?(should we still bus or park at PPMG?)


Very flustered trying to figure out bus routes and their times of departure and stuff, all the websites I've found arent very intuitive with explaining the nuances of the cities bus system. Any help/tips or tricks  would be greatly appreciated.

I've been going to Zoomcare for years to get STI Testing in order to stay on PrEP. I've been paying my deductible as usual, not thinking the testing was covered. Recently, there was a billing error with the pharmacy and in resolving it I discovered that I shouldn't have been paying for HIV testing at all. This notice from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep/paying-for-prep/index.html) and this article from [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-health-and-wellness/prep-hiv-prevention-pill-must-now-totally-free-almost-insurance-plans-rcna1470) show that you shouldn't pay out of pocket for any testing to stay on PrEP or the medication. Not even your deductible. Maybe this was news only to me. I've had to spend hours on the phone and over email with the insurance company and Zoomcare to try and get this worked out and be reimbursed, which hasn't happened yet. The base reason seems to be that Zoomcare hasn't been coding my visits at preventative but as normal clinic visits. They also told me that Gonorrhea/Chlamydia testing isn't covered except for once a year, so I guess the government and insurance companies are fine with everyone getting that.

tldr; If you go to Zoomcare for STI Testing to be on PrEP, you shouldn't be paying anything. Don't pay them in the moment, tell them to get paid by the insurance company.

I live in a home built in the 60s with my husband and two young kids. Since March or so, my two kids and I have been sick with respiratory illnesses every three weeks.

I know we are to expect to get sick more often now that we all have our masks off, but our exposure to germs/people really hasn't changed that much, and every three weeks seems extreme. I'm wondering if anyone out there has been experiencing anything similar? One strange thing is that my husband hasn't gotten any of these sicknesses that we have, so that got us thinking that there is something going on in our environment. My kids and I sleep on the same side of the house, and there was a shed with some black mold in it on that side of the house (we discovered it and took it down last week.) We had a mold specialist do an inspection, and he said that there wasn't anything too red flaggy inside our home. Our air ducts are very dirty, so we are going to get those cleaned, and then we let the ivy grow along our roof which I guess allows too much moisture to get inside the attic, so we took down the ivy.

Thought I would post a little about our experience at the Ren Faire this past Sunday the 14th!

A little about our party, 3 adults and a 4 year old, none of us had ever been to a Ren Faire. 

Like a lot of people I’m sure, we woke up Sunday morning to u/OK-Worth-9525  ‘s post about avoiding the Ren Faire. I read through all the reddit comments and the Google reviews and decided on some changes. One, packed more water than previously planned. Two, I packed a great load of snacks for the four year old and finally, three, we were leaving extra early. 

Packing List:

Water, six bottles and a large yeti  
Sunscreen!!!!!  
Hats for everyone  
Snacks for the four year old  
Walking sneakers  
Umbrellas (not aesthetic, but great for shade)  
Cash  
iPad

We arrived in Bonney Lake at 915 and parking was well directed and unremarkable, we were out of the car by 920. There were portapotties in the lot, so we made use and then wandered up to the gate. It was a bit chaotic but there was a man yelling directions so we paused to hear them. There was only one line- everyone had to go up to the cashiers to either purchase tickets or have prepurchased tickets validated and receive a stamp. The line moved fast once they opened around 945 and we were in by 10:10.

Maps, menus, and the event schedule were posted by QR code all over the place, and each venue had its schedule posted out front, BUT the data that day was not working at all. We could SMS text or call, but data was not happening, which was annoying but not the event’s fault. We had made a must-see list Saturday night off the website and one of our group had the foresight to screenshot the map so we were able to navigate fine before we got our bearings. Some of the things we saw were in the same venue, others were elsewhere, so a lot of our vendor shopping happened as we moved between venues.

1015 We stopped by the Sweden tent to put in our RSVP for the Princess Tea. (Ages 12 and under) We overheard one of the staff comment that they were already 11/15 for spots, so we were glad we went there first!

1030 Raptor Events- This was educational and well presented! Love a birb.

1100 First Joust- Fun!!! The first joust of the day was all tests of skill. Each section cheered for a different knight and the section leaders were great. Four thought it was boring (?! I know), so we split from the others before the end for her to have her face painted. She really really liked this. It was totally smeared off by the end of the day, but her joy made it worth the 25$. 

1200 Lunch- It was SUPER busy in the lunch area, this was kind of where the umbrella came in most handy to create portable shade while you’re standing waiting. Seating was tough to find- there was a LOT but table turnover wasn’t really happening, so we sat on the ground in the shade. Vegetarian options were a bit thin and almost all the food was hot which was rough. Expensive too but of course that’s no surprise for faire food. Four ordered a plain hamburger and ate only the top bun and the fries. The King of Spain came and performed quite a funny burlesque show for the eating crowd.

100 Cydshow Cy the Sword Swallower- This was by far the most anticipated thing for Four, and she loved it. It’s not for the squeamish (like myself); one our group members split to peruse the vendors.

130 Mermaid and Fairy Glen- Four was absolutely entranced by the mermaid and had a lot of fun interacting with the fairies. She really enjoyed the bubbles too. There was a colouring space but every single sheet was completely coloured, which was a bummer.

200 Princess Tea- Back at the Sweden tent we adults lounged around in the shade while the 15 kids sat round a table for tea, lemonade, and cupcakes. Each kid got a gold paper crown and a little pinned badge with a unicorn. Princess Cecilia served the drinks while her sister told the table a story about her unicorn. She was really lovely, clearly had a lot of experience with kids. Once the meal was finished everyone got to go and pet the bunnies and feed the miniature ponies.

300 Storytime with the Wytchwood Players- this was my favourite thing!!! The lady told a wide variety of stories, her voice carried magnificently and she was really engaging. She also introduced a \~10 year old girl and explained she’s still learning and would be telling us the story of how Thor got his hammer. All the adults paid rapt attention, she was soooo nervous it was super sweet.

330 IPad time- Four was flagging hard at this point and becoming quite wiggly. We were staying in the nice cool tent for the puppet show at 400, so I whipped out the iPad and loaded up a movie. We attracted two more kids to the ipad, which gave all us parents a chance to rest and chill. Our other two adults ventured into the afternoon heat to bring back snow cones and a strawberry lemonade, both of which received huge thumbs up from Four.

400 Puppet Show- This was fun and very British, which was enjoyed by all.

445 Sirena- We split the group for the other two adults to go see the final joust at 500 since Four didn’t enjoy the morning joust. Four wanted to hear music so we walked over to the village square to see Sirena. I thought these ladies were awesome, I loved their coordinated dancing and singing and drumming and the vibe was ethereal and spooky. Four did not love it, so we left to walk over to the jousting area to see if we could meet up with the others.

500 Final Joust- We were late to the joust and it was the last of the day, so it was a solid wall of people all the way around the ring. Four and I found a spot in the shade to wait until it was over. The other adults report that they sat front row on the ground and had a great view in the shade. This joust actually involved the competitors riding at each other! The cheering was exciting and I could sort of see from my spot. The event ended about 530 and it seemed like most folks headed for the gates

545 Dinner?- I walked over alone to see about scrounging up dinner and bringing it back to the group. This was Sunday and obviously almost closing time, a LOT of places were out of food, particularly anything vegetarian. Returned empty handed.

600 Equestrian Chaos- Ladies on horseback doing trick archery shots. The other two liked this, I kind of thought it was just OK. Four had absolutely had it and spent the entire time lying on the bleachers flopping around. She got to pet one of the horses at the end which perked her up.

645 Headed Home- Carried Four back to the car and we all used the toilet a final time. It took us sub 10 minutes to get out, totally unremarkable.

Stuff for Next Time: I would bring a small bag for Four. She received a tiny trinket from nearly every place we visited and kids LOVE that stuff, would be good to have a special place for them.

I would also love to do more outfit stuff next time, the costumes on everyone were awesome! I would just keep in mind the following: Linen and cotton ONLY, no polyester fabrics. Would have been nice to have a more aesthetic hat and a cuter parasol type situation.

Parent Pointers: This event was super family friendly, as I hope you can see from my report. LOADS of families of all ages. If you have a wagon-style stroller that definitely seemed like the ticket. Ground is bumpy so you’ll need all terrain wheels if you bring a push stroller. Wish I had packed wet wipes and lysol wipes. We found that every event had shade, but the trick was arriving 5 minutes early so you could snag a good shady spot. Four complained ceaselessly if in the sun longer than 5 minutes, so for us hopping between stages made the most sense. There are no refillable water stations, and the water for sale is 4$ a bottle cash only so pack tons. We passed several change table/nursing stations that are well marked if you need that. Lost Children marker is right by the entrance, Medical tent is off the food court.

Unexpected: Tipping! I’ve never been to a Renaissance Faire, and every act we saw asked for tips. Some even had their Venmo tag. You weren’t obligated to but it was quite interesting.

Final Thoughts: This was super fun and we will go again next year, though definitely on a Sunday not a Saturday. Arriving early and leaving late appeared to be key for our smooth experience– I see from the FB page that departing in the late afternoon was a shitshow. If we hadn’t come in one car I would have attempted to take Four home after the puppet show, but she honestly managed really well even beyond her limits and I was very proud of her. I was glad we had made a plan the night before and would do so again, because I felt like we saw nearly everything we wanted to see.

TL;DR  It was fun!

Rent costs:

I often hear that the rising rent costs is one of the root cause of homelessness.

I think it's not true.

Let's assume if minimum rents fall to 100$ per month from today.
Can we assume that entire homeless people would vanish from the streets and turn into rent paying individuals?


Poverty :
I see section 8 housing, transitionary housing, remote suburbs with lower rents. 

Why would a hustling individual stuck in poverty stay on streets with hazardous conditions?

Mental health issues:

Everything points to mental health. 


Breaking down the problem :

Poverty+high rents+unlucky:

This group must be unluck due various life choices or accidents.
We as a society should build enough safety nets and helping hands to bring them back on to their regular life.

How much help do i get if lose all my savings and land road tomorrow?

Is this help available to everyone? What would be cost per individual?


Anything+mental health issues:

This group need special assistance. I believe whatever we do, if it's not treating their underlying mental health issues, they will return to streets.

How many hospitals or mental health care centers do we have today? 
If i get affected by a mental health crisis, what's my future in this society?


Budgets:
Seattle is spending 173 million per year on homeless.

It was 77 million in 2018.


Some solutions/thought experiments :

1. create a set of facilities for treating mental health. With a capacity of atleast 15000. Distributed across the region. 
Should not be an asylum, but should have a full medical care. ( What would be cost of this? )

2. Create a set of help centers for struggling people. Recruit police into help line, so that they can connect needy on roads with help centers immediately.


 3. Make homelessness civil offense. This will nudge the people to reach out help. Can create legal framework for the city to pull them out of the homelessness and offer help with some authority.



4. Stop advertising homelessness. I believe the scene of homelessness is acting like an advertisement for current youth.

Any help that anyone could provide would be wonderful!

Here's some rough info about us to help narrow down locations:
- Married, both 25
- No kids or plans for kids (don't hate kids though)
- 1 large dog, want another
- I will be working for a tech company downtown, currently allowed to work remote, but I would like to work in-office on occasion.
- I'm fine with 30m commute, would like to avoid anything over 40m commute if possible.
- We'd very much love to rent a smaller house, 2-3 bedrooms with a yard and driveway. Also open to apartments if possible. Rent budget is around $3k/mo, but flexible if something is worth another few hundred.
- We love the diversity and inclusion of the Seattle area and want to be surrounded by that as much as possible (politically)!
- We'd prefer an open, quiet area rathe than loud and busy.

Currently we're looking at areas about 30m north -- Lynnwood? Bothell? Mill Creek? We also think east of Lake Washington would be nice but possibly too expensive? Anything affordable near Bellevue/Kirkland/Redmond area that fits us?

We're completely clueless on what cultures are like in these areas, other than the Bellevue area seems.. ritzy? This isn't particularly bad because we essentially live in the 'ritzy' part of our MCOL City at the moment, so it's 'comfortable' to us I guess.

Is everyone free to do whatever they want because nobody will hold them accountable?

TL;DR: Within just 2 hours this afternoon, my car was damaged twice while trying to accomplish simple tasks for friends. Neither person took responsibility for the damage caused. 

Incident 1: A friend asked me to let her dog out because she had a long shift at a local hospital. Sure, no problem - my schedule allowed for it. As I was sitting at a stop light near her home, the driver of the car in front of me took his foot off his break for no apparent reason. The light was still red. There was ample room in between us. I drive a newer manual SUV, so I am not an asshole when it comes to the distance between cars, especially on hills. Despite me honking at him, his car rolled backward a few feet into my front-end bumper until it came to a complete stop up against the weight of my vehicle. I turned on my emergency lights, and motioned for him to pull over to exchange info, the proper steps to take - but he decided to take off instead. So I followed him to the next red light, where I got out of my vehicle to take a photo of his license plate, the damage done to his vehicle, and the damage to my car. He took off again as soon as the light turned green. I safely moved to a side street to file a claim with my insurance and make a police report of the incident. Luckily they know the identity of the car owner based on the information I provided. I was not injured, and the damage to my car was not undrivable, so I continued on my way to let the dog out and give him some good scritches. I was annoyed at the inconvenience and lack of consideration, but all good - everything is fixable kind of attitude. 

Incident 2: I left the dog and started on my very next task - going to the store to pick up cat food for the friend’s cat I am petsitting. When I got to the parking lot entrance of the grocery store, I saw a homeless man walking sideways in the middle of the lane I was forced to turn into from the main road. The man was clearly under the influence of something heavy. I didn't want to hit him, so I moved slowly and still ended up having to swerve around him. He then aggressively came directly at my car, kicked the rear passenger side of it, threw his beer can at my window, and as if that wasn't enough, he attempted to kick the SUV following closely behind me. He then walked off. Slightly in shock, I parked and got out of the car to assess the damage. The driver from the car behind me kindly came to check on me, “What the f**k was that? Are you okay? He tried to kick my car too.” There is now a clear boot print and dent in the side of my car. The homeless man disappeared, and it isn't like they would do anything about him or get deductible money out of him, so there was no point in filing another police report or insurance claim. 

My car was in good shape this morning. And as of right now, I am financially responsible for paying for the damage caused by two strangers’ unnecessary and rude behavior.

Hi all! My partner and I are planning an anniversary trip for 4 nights at the very end of Sept. Don’t shoot me — I’m not here to ask “Where should I stay?” / “What should I do?” “How do I get around?” / etc. like I’ve seen many do while giving little to no info and w/o doing their own research.

We will be renting a car for the duration of our visit, and our combined budget is ~1k for the place alone. We do have about 3-4 places we’re trying to choose between, all in diff areas, so I’d like to know if y’all would have any reasons to not stay in any one of them (primarily if you think they’re too far out) and/or which of our options you think would be most ideal based on our itinerary.

I’d say the top 3 neighbourhoods I’ve seen most recommended were Capitol Hill, Fremont, and Ballard, probably followed closely by SLU and (South?) Queen Anne. Unfortunately, I can’t find a hotel nor Airbnb that’s a) still available in those areas, b) within our budget, and c) something we actually both like.

Our options are in (North) Tacoma, Bonney Lake, and Edmonds (I think I might’ve found two more potential spots — one in South Park and the other in Tukwila, which I believe would be closest to everything).

Over the 4 days we’ll be there, we’re hoping to see/do a lot of the typical tourist-y stuff like visit at least a few diff museums, visit a lot of the popular Downtown attractions, go hiking in MRNP (or elsewhere if there’s something better?), maybe see a Kraken hockey game, maybe see some standup, and that covers most, if not everything.

I’d also like to know if y’all think that plan is doable or overkill for the # of days we’ll have, &amp; if there’s things I should skip or absolutely must see/do/try.

It typically takes place every Monday, at 7:30 PM at [Optimism Brewing](https://optimismbrewing.com/), 1158 Broadway (except for when the brewery closes for holidays, employee appreciation events, apocalyptic occurrences, etc.).

Start time is typically more like 7:15, as people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. Don't worry if you don't see any games as they'll be brought out soon enough. If you're new, I typically am there in a bright red Seattle Humane shirt as most of the time I'll be coming straight from my volunteer shift (although this isn't always the case). I will also get a reservation for the group so a little placard should be out as well.

In regards to food, Optimism does not have a kitchen but does allow food from outside. They also almost always have a food truck show up every night. [Food truck calendar here](https://optimismbrewing.com/food-trucks). *We ask that you please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ:

Q.) *What kind of games are played? Should I bring mine?*

A.) A whole slew of games are played; from short games like Codenames and Liars Dice, to longer ones like Evolution and Scythe. And feel free to bring your own games, too. You might find some people who are interested in trying it out.

Q.) *I don't really know how to play any board games besides x, y, z.... Will I be welcome here?*

A.) That's completely fine. There are plenty of people who are willing to explain the rules and do quite a good job at it, too.

Q.) *Speaking of being welcome, what kind of people are allowed to attend?*

A.) Everyone is welcome, so long as you are polite, respectful, and considerate of the other patrons. Also know that Optimism is a dog friendly bar, so bring your pup if you'd like. And if you're allergic, be sure to take any medicine before attending.

Q.) *I don't drink alcohol, but want to be supportive of Optimism. How can I still be a good patron?*

A.) Optimism also sells a non alcoholic $1 bubbly, crisp, sparkling water that I have enjoyed before. And if you can't handle any sort of carbonation, then there's no need to buy anything. You can support Optimism in another ways: telling your friends about the venue, grabbing and bussing any glasses someone may have left behind at another table while on your way out, etc.

Q.) *There's another huge board game group there... are you a part of them?*

A.) Nope! That is the Seattle Gaymers group. They're super organized, have a Facebook group, and even have a welcoming table.

I'd really appreciate some advice on my renting situation.

I have been living in a duplex for 4 years (1 year lease + 3 year lease that ended in June 2022). I love living here and would like to continue living here for the next 3 years at least, even possibly up to 5 years. 

That being said, my landlord hasn't said anything about the lease ending. I've just been paying rent as normal. This also happened after my first 1 year lease ended, after which I reminded them and this resulted in me getting my rent increased $100/month which was not negotiable despite my desire to sign a somewhat longer 3 year lease. It's also worth noting that the landlord had the roof replaced about a year ago and hasn't shown any interest in selling the place. They are generally extremely hands-off with the property.

Questions:

1. Since I like living here and could see myself doing it for the next 3-5 years, what should I do here? Part of me wants to stay under the radar and avoid getting my rent increased, the other wants the security of knowing I have a lease signed. 
2. What sort of protections do I have now that my lease has ended? Does the 10%/180 rule still apply to me?

We have been looking at Maple Valley, but not too many homes come out in the area, unfortunately.  We were initially looking at Lake Stevens, but when we visited Maple Valley earlier this year, we fell in love with the place. 

We visited Black Diamond (Ten Trails) very close to Maple Valley as well as Bonney Lake (Tehaleh), but there was a big ""Pleasantville"" vibe from these areas.  

Are there other areas similar to Maple Valley that you'd recommend for a couple in their 30s looking for their first home?  Our budget is up to 800K.

The Laurie Lewis Quintet (no relation to the American bluegrass singer) is a contemporary jazz group anchored by Lewis who has a long career in arrangement, music direction, and radio in both New Zealand and Australia. *Seattle in Summer* comes from their 2005 album, *A Sense of Wonder*, which represents their first foray into songwriting. *Summer*'s soft and listing guitar creates a sense of idyllic nostalgia, as the crooning vocals long for an on-and-off again summertime relationship in Seattle.

^(What is Seattle Song Sunday? I'm trying to highlight songs about Seattle or from local artists in a weekly post. Songs that tell a story about Seattle, anthems and odes to the city and surroundings, or diss tracks about the town and its weather. There's more than any one person can know, so if you know any or have your own favorites, or have a story to tell about a song, please send them my way!)

I have wanted a child for as long as I can remember and after getting sick in Utah and surviving my surgeries and near-death experience; I had given up on having children because I thought I would never be healthy enough. After working hard and waiting to heal from my kidney/pancreas transplant, I was told it was safe for me to have children. But after 2 years, I went to the doctor and was told that I would have a very slim chance of getting pregnant naturally. So this is the most effective thing we can do. I am 34 years old and I am afraid that as I get older, it will be difficult to have a child. We have wanted this for so long and I was heartbroken when I found out about my tubes.

She's on a boat load of medications to help but she's still got chronic pain. As many dogs do as they get older, she's become less tolerant of other dogs. Her vet agrees that it's probably related to her pain in addition to just getting older. I am working with her on it and she's so amazingly responsive and eager to please. However, despite the fact that she is mostly reactive while on leash and she has shown great improvement I'm sure you can understand that out of an abundance of caution and respect for other people and their dogs I won't take her to off leash areas around town. It's not worth the risk.

My dog has one huge joy in life and I'd really like to give it to her. She loves to swim after balls or sticks in the water. I haven't been able to take her on a swim in a very long time. It's also great for keeping her strength up and reducing her pain. I want to find a relatively low traffic place where she can swim. I realize this is not going to be in the city limits. I'm willing to travel. 

What I'm looking for is something with: 


* deep enough water for a medium-sized dog to swim in 


* A relatively graded entrance into the water (she won't jump in) that doesn't have a lot of boulders she will have to scramble over to get in. 


* A gentle current like in a river is ok. She wears a life vest and I float the end of the leash so that I can grab it and her in an emergency. I also wouldn't let her swim in a strong current of course. 


* A short hike to get there is ok, 20-30 mins or so. 


*Water temp is not much of a concern as long as it's not like ya know, *freezing*.

If you have any other recommendations in the 250/300-or-less price range I’d love to hear them! The main thing is I’ll be heading to Bainbridge via ferry a couple times so being in downtown and within a short Uber distance to the ferry is big.

I live in Cap Hill, and yesterday as I was washing my motorcycle on the street and I heard a really serious sounding scream. I looked around and couldn't figure out where it had come from, and then a grey Nissan SUV with completely tinted windows came driving by. As they were going by, the rear passenger door opened and a female inside screamed ""SOMEONE HELP ME!!"" before the car slammed on the gas and sped off.

There were lots of people on the street, and one middle-aged gentleman was even crossing the street besides the car as this happened. In that split second, I just instinctively ran after the car. Chased it a block and a half before I realized there was no way I was catching them, and I saw an older man starting up his car. I ran over to his window and quickly explained what was going on, and that it sounded like something terrible was happening and we needed to chase this car. Major respect to this guy, because he was 100% committed to catching this car and we sped after them. 

Thankfully there was some traffic at a red light, and the car was stuck at a red light right next to Al Bacha Gyros. I told the guy to get ready to call the police and ran up to the car, having no idea what to expect next. I tried to open the passenger door and it was locked, so I started banging on the window. These people rolled down the window, and inside was an adult male driving with 2 adult female passengers. They were all CRACKING UP LAUGHING! Thought it was hilarious that I had chased them as far as I did. ""It was a joke man, calm down!"". I couldn't even believe it, I was so shocked in that moment that I didn't even know what to say. Ended up just walking back to the guy's car who drove me to give him a fist bump and let him know that everything was fine.

As I'm walking back to my motorcycle, I see a few people meandering around and looking around concerned. I talked to 2 separate groups of people who had witnessed the whole thing, and not only did none of them do anything, they didn't even pick up the phone to call the cops.

I'm just pissed and disappointed. At the people who thought this was some hilarious joke and at the bystanders. Such a disgusting situation all around, and the only saving grace is that this guy starting up his car who had no idea what was going on was willing to get involved and help me chase after them.

What exactly does this mean? I’m trying to understand the laws before I approach the office about this and let them know about their mistake.

1) If I wait longer to talk to them and they therefore take longer to provide me with a lease offer with the correct start date, does the 180 days start at that point when they offer me a renewal with the correct start date? Or did the 180 days start when they sent this current notice because it still tells me they intend to increase rent?


2) Aside from basic negotiation, is there any way I can legally take advantage of the situation to keep the increase smaller or even keep my rent the same? I expected a rent increase but what they offered is more than 20% increase and is kind of bananas to me. 

I understand there’s an additional law to help people if they are priced out of their homes by an increase more than 10% but I believe I make too much money for that to apply to me.

We are a lab in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at UW ([http://faculty.washington.edu/ludomax/lab/](http://faculty.washington.edu/ludomax/lab/)) and we're constantly looking for adults (and children!) for our research studies! We recruit adults who stutter and adults who do not stutter (as well as children who stutter and children who do not stutter!) for a variety of experiments in which **you'll be compensated $15/hr**. We can **reimburse for street parking** and we will provide you with a **free hearing screening** as part of the experiment.

Most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words off a screen, although some also involve wearing an electrode cap (like a swim cap) so we can measure your brain activity. Children's experiments involve a free speech and language evaluation by a clinician as well as a small toy for your child.

If you are interested, or have any questions at all, please email us at [maxlab@uw.edu](mailto:maxlab@uw.edu)!

While there are plenty of activities to do with friends that don't have to cost a lot, eating out is still a traditional mainstay. It seems like the cheapest item on a menu lately will be like $18 for a sandwich with fries or something. If I go to a mid-tier chain like Red Robin for a work lunch, my meal easily ends up being over $20. I don't believe it's possible to get a good meal with good ambiance for under $30 at this point.

I'm still seeing 20% mandatory gratuities and pandemic surcharges in fine print, so it's not like the restaurants are actually building tips into their employees' wages by raising the prices. And there was the whole debate about whether or not you should tip a takeout place when they ""turn the ipad around"" on you.

Don't get me wrong, I aim to cook breakfast/lunch/dinner everyday except a few occasions on the weekends. I pretty much never order takeout. I realize that it's a completely non-essential expense for good reason, but I would still like to support (not to mention check out) all of the cool restaurants that the Seattle area has to offer. 

Like much everything else affected by inflation (especially the groceries that I buy to avoid this in the first place), it sucks to see that I have continuously dwindling buying power. I don't want to be the pennypincher friend who cheaps out, so I try to just swallow the cost whenever someone invites me out purely because socializing has been a hard-to-find opportunity for me.

The state’s natural population increase of 14,100 hit historic lows as births declined more slowly than in recent years but COVID-19 increased the number of overall deaths.

The Emerald City set a new OFM high of 762,500 as of April 1, 2022, which is an increase of 20,100 residents (+2.7%) from the previous April. Far outpacing the suburbs, Seattle accounted for two-thirds of King County's annual population growth — tallied at 30,650 (+1.3%) by OFM.

A glad-hander at the Seattle Chamber of Commerce named Arthur Priest decided Seattle needed a day dedicated to befriending strangers. He launched Talk to Your Neighbor Day in April 1920:
 “Seattle people have been accused of being too cold and distant,” reported The Seattle Times. “It is being charged that old time Seattle residents are not inclined to converse with people who share their seats on the street cars. Strangers in the city maintain that their polite inquiry regarding the probability that it will rain tomorrow is usually met with a grunt.”
A headline on the story: “Seattle Expected to Thaw Out.” The Freeze was already a thing.
Funny enough, Talk to Your Neighbor Day appears to have been a flop in Seattle. The city didn’t respond and didn’t want to do it again. Priest left town for, presumably, friendlier pastures.
So, did Seattle warm up after that?
No. Another cold spell appeared in the early stages of WWII. In 1942, a woman who came to Seattle from Idaho with her family for wartime work — a writer named Helen Markley Miller —blasted the locals in newspaper stories about what an unfriendly, unneighborly city we were.
“Seattle as a word may have a musical sound, a lilt of its own to all you elder residents, but to me it is an Indian word meaning ‘phooey,’ ” she wrote. The city lacked affordable housing, the old-timers were “clubby,” and the city run by “smug burghers.”
It sounds like the classic Freeze complaints you still hear here in the 21st century.
Interestingly, complaints seem to spike in periods of high population growth, lack of affordability, times when Seattle has been around long enough to have locals who felt well-rooted. When everybody was new to town, few complained. When the ratio of newcomers blossomed, it was grumpy time.
Said one local about Helen Markley Miller’s criticism: “We were a nice peaceful town once and who has changed it? Youse guys.”

We will have our 2 small children with us. They are 5 and 2.

I’m looking for advice where to stay and where we will feel the most safe and comfortable. Lately, we have only been seeing and hearing about all the horrific things and the decline in Seattle. 

This also is the case with San Francisco which we frequently visit. We still walk most neighborhoods. We aren’t in complete shock by the problems that major cities face. The difference is we are familiar with what neighborhoods to avoid and how to safely navigate.

Would you feel comfortable staying downtown and walking back and forth to a hotel with small children? After dark? We will be on a month long road trip. We are traveling with a camper shell on our truck. If we drive every where and park what’s the likelihood our camper shell will be broken into? If we keep our vehicle parked at our hotel could we just ride public transit? 

We are driving up from California and will be road tripping through Olympic, Mt Rainer and North Cascades. 

A couple things on our list to do (all very touristy but it’s our first visit!) 

Watch a Mariners game at T-mobile 
Pikes Place Market 
Starbucks Reserve 
The Seattle Great Wheel
REI flagship store
Seattle Aquarium 
Seattle Center Armory Food Court

It's been vacant since then while we line up contractors to fix a few things before we move in. We go through the house probably once every couple weeks to do some light work (e.g., painting) and check up on the place. (We'd go more often but have a newborn at home.)

Back in May, we noticed someone had broken in and stolen tools. SPD came out and took a look around, presumably wrote up a report; no one was there at the time.

A while later - probably June sometime - it looked like someone had been in the house again. And since then we've gotten sporadic updates from the neighbors that they're seeing doors left open, lights on, stuff like that. But each time we went through, no one was there and the house looked more or less as we left it. We changed locks, added deadbolts.

Cut to a few weeks ago and activity at the house really started to ramp up. I called police a few more times when neighbors reported people were actively entering the house, but the police never showed even though dispatch said they were sending a unit. (Yeah, I get that there are more important things to worry about than a vacant house.) I didn't feel comfortable going in myself, especially not with a baby strapped to my chest. 

Anyways, today a construction crew went in to start work. No one was there but it looked like people had left in a hurry, probably when they heard the crew coming in. The crew found drugs, bullets, stolen goods and a big mess (which wasn't there as of a few weeks ago). Called police, again no show. When the crew left for 15 minutes, someone broke in again to reclaim stuff they left behind (at least, what hadn't already been taken to the dump).

That's a lot of context for this question: Anyone have any advice or recommendations on how to secure the house? Or otherwise deter this group of people from returning? There may be a few lulls between demolition work, build work, and move-in (not huge lulls, but working around the crew's schedule) ... so how can we keep the place from becoming a drug den / squat house again? Thinking we board it up, sign up with ADT... But is ADT worth it if they're just going to call the police and the police aren't going to respond? Are there other options?

She had an ankle injury a few years back and hasn't really had full mobility since, so she usually takes the ONE parking spot in front of our house (I park right behind her, blocking our own driveway but nowhere near anyone else's-- our driveway is too small to actually park in and is at a weird angle where my bumper bottoms out every time). Our house is the only one on the block with room for only one car in front of it, the others either have a full-size driveway or room for at least 3 cars right out front. 

Our next-door neighbors rent out their basement to long-term tenants. I've never had the chance to meet any of them, but they're all pretty quiet and keep to themselves. Their current tenant (who I think has been with them for the last few years) is *always* parking in the one spot outside of our house. Not only does this house have a 4-car driveway (which I completely understand not wanting to park in if you're renting the basement, it might feel awkward) but they're on the corner with two full sides of parking every day. I think I've seen maybe *one other car* park outside of their house. I've noticed that she will park in the spot outside of our house and keep her car there for up to 6 days straight without ever using it. Then my mom parks in front of our driveway (making it a little bit harder for her to get into the house because of her injury) and I have to park a bit further up the street. I've never understood how this is easier on HER either, she's just parking 50ft further from her house than she needs to. 

I feel like I total asshole whenever I get annoyed. It's just a parking spot, right??? I've thought about leaving a note just explaining why I would like that space to be available for my mom, but I don't want to look/sound unreasonable.

She is an incredible woman and means the world to me. We are looking at bridesmaid dresses and it has been hard because she is plus-size and wears a HH cup bra (not sure what size band). There are lots of cute bridesmaids dresses out there, and we’ve found at least one she can wear with a normal, thick strapped bra, that will work with my dress and I think she’ll look very pretty in. But most od the dresses that fit her requirements look matronly, and she obviously doesn’t want that.  If possible, I’d like to see her in a few dresses that I think she would look absolutely stunning (like I see the dress and I immediately think of her) in but have off the shoulder sleeves or straps. (Side rant: why are 98% of bridesmaids dresses made to require a strapless bra??? Even girls with DD cups don’t always want to do that).


She says she’s never gone strapless because she needs the full support, but also that she’s never really gone looking for a good, well made, strapless bra designed with women of her shape in mind. She says she’s more than willing to look though. Im trying to look and see if there is anything in the Seattle area that does that, but don’t really know what to look for. Any other ladies out here know of any stores in or near Seattle we could go that will make it a positive experience?

Anyway, given she's very into nature, the woods, plant identification (in particular edible plants), and mushrooming, I'm wondering if anybody would be kind enough to give any targeted suggestions about potential gift ideas for her.

An example of some ideas that I was considering that would be Seattle specific:

1. A membership into some sort of mushroom group in Seattle?
2. A year pass into _______ park(s) system(s) where she could mushroom?

Stuff like that. I'm posting in this subreddit of course because I'd like to do something thoughtful for her that is targeted to her new (temporary!) community / area. I _could_ (and may) buy her ""things"", e.g. a knife for cutting mushrooms, but honestly she's pretty minimalist and not at all fussy so is fine bringing a kitchen knife or a canvas shopping bag with her to collect stuff. I mention this because if there are any really specific items that would be amazing and are Seattle / Pacific Northwest specific you can think of I'm all ears, but I'm most interested in non-thing gifts, if that makes sense.

Are these competitive wages with other restaurants and cafes in the area? Because to me this seems like a very large Seattle / Portland company with cafes and distribution across multiple states and much more through wholesale, trying the bare minimum to attract people.

They're shutting the cafe until they can find people who will accept table scraps instead of paying wages in line with other similar places. 

(It's not like their prices justify such low pay)

Meanwhile, if you want to be a barista in Seattle it seems like there are [plenty of opportunities paying a lot more than minimum wage](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=barista&amp;l=Seattle%2C%20WA)...

It typically takes place every Monday, at 7:30 PM at [Optimism Brewing](https://optimismbrewing.com/), 1158 Broadway (except for when the brewery closes for holidays, employee appreciation events, apocalyptic occurrences, etc.).

Start time is typically more like 7:15, as people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. Don't worry if you don't see any games as they'll be brought out soon enough. If you're new, I typically am there in a bright red Seattle Humane shirt as most of the time I'll be coming straight from my volunteer shift (although this isn't always the case). I will also get a reservation for the group so a little placard should be out as well.

In regards to food, Optimism does not have a kitchen but does allow food from outside. They also almost always have a food truck show up every night. [Food truck calendar here](https://optimismbrewing.com/food-trucks). *We ask that you please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ:

Q.) *What kind of games are played? Should I bring mine?*

A.) A whole slew of games are played; from short games like Codenames and Liars Dice, to longer ones like Evolution and Scythe. And feel free to bring your own games, too. You might find some people who are interested in trying it out.

Q.) *I don't really know how to play any board games besides x, y, z.... Will I be welcome here?*

A.) That's completely fine. There are plenty of people who are willing to explain the rules and do quite a good job at it, too.

Q.) *Speaking of being welcome, what kind of people are allowed to attend?*

A.) Everyone is welcome, so long as you are polite, respectful, and considerate of the other patrons. Also know that Optimism is a dog friendly bar, so bring your pup if you'd like. And if you're allergic, be sure to take any medicine before attending.

Q.) *I don't drink alcohol, but want to be supportive of Optimism. How can I still be a good patron?*

A.) Optimism also sells a non alcoholic $1 bubbly, crisp, sparkling water that I have enjoyed before. And if you can't handle any sort of carbonation, then there's no need to buy anything. You can support Optimism in another ways: telling your friends about the venue, grabbing and bussing any glasses someone may have left behind at another table while on your way out, etc.

Q.) *There's another huge board game group there... are you a part of them?*

A.) Nope! That is the Seattle Gaymers group. They're super organized, have a Facebook group, and even have a welcoming table. However, there have been times when someone from their group has mingled with ours and that's been fine.",True,False,False,Seattle,t5_2qhad,469981,public,self,Monday Capitol Hill Board Game Night: 7:30 pm at Optimism,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/wizntt/monday_capitol_hill_board_game_night_730_pm_at/,all_ads,6,flair,,Meetup,,dark,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'FFPlYVz6CPoG8F8csoqLuKbjY-sCea7KsZrgnvjp44A', 'resolutions': [{'height': 127, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/PyGAH9iOOKcHuFOkNffZ2neCc0pK5kaAyFLgdqo9kU4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f83dc2602d0ddfbcb94acca3680d725b3d006ac', 'width': 108}, {'height': 254, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/PyGAH9iOOKcHuFOkNffZ2neCc0pK5kaAyFLgdqo9kU4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93b4367f24fbc27e59ef94b3d2896d7fffa8584c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 377, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/PyGAH9iOOKcHuFOkNffZ2neCc0pK5kaAyFLgdqo9kU4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed4e7a2e8ae045b0c5e5b7598ce51a9d24d1890', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 615, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/PyGAH9iOOKcHuFOkNffZ2neCc0pK5kaAyFLgdqo9kU4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=43abfc9636b08751c548c5004596b62dc52aa4a1', 'width': 522}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

tomorrow i am working at the mariners game in the afternoon. i am planning on parking my car at the angel lake station and taking the light rail into the stadium district i guess. is there anything i need to be worried about? will my car be safe parking at the angel lake lot until i return at 11pm? (obviously i know to hide everything inside). will the walk from the park to the light rail in stadium district be safe after 10pm? is is best to download the ORCA app beforehand or is a debit card okay? i mean it seems pretty easy; park car, buy ticket, get on light rail, get off light rail at right spot. walk to destination. repeat. but ya know, anxiety. lol i really wanna utilize public transit here more but I'm just afraid of scary stuff happening to me.

This event (Whiskey and Wild Bites at Woodland Park Zoo) was framed as a way to eat and drink and hang out with the animals, $100 per person. My boyfriend is really into whiskey and we both love animals and food so it seemed like a home run date night. It was clear that it was meant to be unlimited “bites” from local restaurants and each admission ticket comes with eight drink tickets to use at whiskey/wine vendor booths. 

The reality: this event was a complete and laughable disaster. When we got there the line just to get in wound around all the parking lots  all the way to outside the zoo. So we knew it was probably going to be a shitshow just based on how many people were in this Disneyland line and knowing how few food vendors would be there. 

I have no idea who thought that this event would work but there were maybe 15 food booths and 12 drink booths. Every single booth had a line at least 20 min long (maybe 70-100 people), and do the math - the event started at 5, and there were signs everywhere that last call for everything was 8:30. There was absolutely no way that anyone could reasonably stand in every line to try all the things and also do anything else beside standing in line. There needed to be at least 2x or 3x the number of food and drink booths for the amount of people there. Or make it vastly easier for people to get in and out and grab bites quickly to eliminate the lines, because people were shuffling as slowly as they possibly could trying to read the menus or talk to food staff. As it was though, everywhere throughout the entire zoo was just people standing in lines. 

We split up to try and get one food and one drink for both of us, I waited in line about 15 min was told I was only allowed one food portion. The portion was comically small and the food itself was pretty meh. I joined my boyfriend in the Laphroig line and we waited at least 15 min (he had already been there about 15 min before I got there). By the time we got to the front we could see how comically small the drink pours were as well. I understand if you as an event planner assume everyone will use all 8 of their tickets that you’d want to make sure pours are small, but you’d literally be waiting in drinks lines for the entire event to do that so what even is the point? 

Oh also, a bunch of food booths started running out of food at 7pm (halfway through). Very obviously they did not know how many people would be demanding food. We didn’t even bother with trying to get more food or drinks after our first lines and decided to instead try and see as many animals as we could. Basically I paid $200 for a few bites of chicken and roughly half a shot of scotch and got to see a few animals out and about. We left around 8 and got our much better dinner close by. 

It’s hard to know if they just way, way oversold tickets for this event thinking it would just work out and didn’t inform the food and drink vendors so they could properly prep for the unrelenting mass of people in lines for their shit, but this was a pretty shameful display for the zoo event planning committee. 

The moral of the story here - absolutely skip this event if it ever happens again. Please learn from my expensive mistake. If you want to benefit the zoo, just make a donation directly to them. I wish I could have gotten a refund and just paid the zoo directly. The zoo itself was feeling pretty sad since the last time I went and honestly I would understand why they would be struggling these days. I e never gone to an event like this before and now it’s a guarantee I won’t ever attend another.

So I have this opportunity at Meta and I can choose between Menlo Park, NYC or Seattle.
So I will start by saying that I am not from the States (coming from Europe), so I don't really know a lot about how state taxes etc work in the USA.
A lil description of me I am a 24F, like sunny places, don't really love big big cities (because it's too chaotic and overstimulating), but I also don't like places in which there is nothing to do.
I would like to find a place in which I can experience the culture without draining my bank account and also feel quite safe (somewhat low crime rate or drug abuse)🥴.
The base pay will be around 120k, as I stated previously I don't know how income state taxes work in the US, but I would like to have enough money to live comfortably after taxes, rent and food (I am quite a frugal person).
I wanted to choose Seattle, but I read a lot of subreddit talking about how the situation socially is really bad with drugs used even in buses around other people and homeless people being aggressive.
I know that I am asking for a lot, but I would like to know from everyone here which city is closer to my personality etc.

Today, was a very sad day for me. I don’t want to get into the emotional part bc it just makes this message longer and harder to ask for something simple out of human decency!

No one should need to provide proof of a physical ticket, no larger than a quarter, in order to leave the parking facility of SEA-TAC Airport! While trying to exit the parking garage, I wasted over an hour in the parking line because I lost my ticket 🤦🏻‍♂️. 

Note: I usually leave it in my car bc why take it, it was just one of those days ya know where bad things come in 3’s I got em all TODAY.

Pulled into the normal debit/credit lane behind 7-8 cars. As I get to the machine, I wasn’t like FUCK, I did that with 4 cars behind me. I press the assistance button and this is how I was first assisted. They had me and the 6-7 cars behind me back up so then now I can go wait in the lost ticket/cash only lane with 9-10 cars ahead of me. Fine, not even mad at them, still analyzing where my ticket probably got lost at. None the less, I get to the parking attendant tell her my situation probably close to the same as every other person maybe not who knows but I was parked 15-25 mins.
But after waiting behind 2 full lanes of cars. I realize they could’ve easily helped me at the first window. Now they tell me if I won’t pay the 34.00 for a full day of parking they’re keeping my vehicle but I was free to leave. Asked for a manger one came after 5 mins. Still not sure he was a manager because of the level of professionalism but he stated the same

I called the non-emergency police line requested an officer and after about 10 mins an officer arrived and was informed.  I showed him a ticket and a flight number of which my children were traveling on all within the last hour. I then seen an officer pay for the parking fee of $34.00, after telling them the same story snd requesting video footage. I gave them a military coin I earned while serving and drive home after having plans of catching the 10:30 ferry. 

All in all, I know certain jobs you deal with some shitty people but that doesn’t mean everyone is lying. Are people really that far off reality they don’t care about treating someone as if they’d like to be treated.

Understand everyone as if you’ve lived their life.


Side note 1: If I would’ve reversed my car into anything that you requested I do “they’ll back up just put it in reverse and pull into the lost ticket/cash only lane.” and I obliged to do so, that company in charge of parking is paying my car bill and whomever else is involved. No ground guide in a busy parking booth.

Washington is on our shortlist and we narrowed that down to the area surrounding Seattle but I only have firsthand experience with the city proper (and this was pre Covid). 

I'm not concerned with housing prices or school district ratings since I can look all that up. But I'd really love to know cultural elements like how safe it feels, does it cater to family friendly vs college age vs closer to retirement, etc. Are there lots of kid friendly parks (sorry if this is a dumb question for the pacific northwest).

If anyone from Ohio is in Seattle now I'd love to hear any comparative town/suburb examples too. This Seattle suburb is similar to that Ohio one in terms of small town feel, or walkability, or commercial development. 

Some helpful info to know is that we're currently in a smaller population area (14,000) but a 30-40 minute drive and we're into a city. A five minute drive the other direction and I'm passing farms. We have a small downtown area (only two story buildings) that's full of  historic houses turned into boutique stores and independent restaurants. Overall, the area is wealthy and our income falls into upper levels. 

Our current neighborhood is very Midwest stereotype. Friendly neighbors who invite you over for barbecues or kids birthday parties. Kids ride bikes through the suburb streets because they're not main roads. I realize I'm describing the Midwest values trope but it's a real thing. We do not have white picket fences though. Our HOA only allows one type of black iron anyway. Making fun of ourselves...but true.

Pioneer Square smells like piss. I'm fully aware that in cities of a certain size, in the heat of the summer, you're gonna smell some piss. Usually it's in alleyways. Certainly it's near dumpsters or parking garages. 

But holy fuck, Pioneer Square. It's like it rained piss there. It is as though there is a river of piss somewhere nearby. Like, if you told me that the very bricks and pavement were just solidified piss and it was all melting a little bit in the summer sun, I would 100% believe you.

The first thing that comes to mind is pressure-washing the sidewalks. Is that something the city can/has the jurisdiction to do, or is it the responsibility/right of the building owners? 

Honestly my first concern with this would be the amount of solid waste and garbage that would need to be cleared lest it clog drains. 

So now we need two things: the ability to pressurewash sidewalks, and someone to general clean garbage and debris from the sidewalks. I guess we can put a caveat in and say, if there is a tent or someone on the sidewalk, that particular spot  need not be powerwashed as long as someone is there, but there is plenty of empty pavement that needs to be hosed down.

Based on what I've seen in other cities, this means we need a [fleet of CityVac-like vehicles.](https://www.multihog.com/multihog-attachment/cityvac-trash-vacuum)

This got me thinking about the trash/litter situation in general. A few people have noted that Seattle streets are particularly devoid of trash cans. Has this always been the case? Is there something preventing garbage cans or recycling bins? My first concern is that homeless people will compulsively empty trash cans onto the street, and that may be why they were taken away. The other consideration would be that there simply isn't room on a lot of those older downtown sidewalks for massive trash cans that wouldn't overflow within 24 hours, without also impeding pedestrians and accessibility.

I figure people who like to argue will simply go for the ""we need to solve homelessness first, then the garbage cans will be left alone, which will help keep litter from piling on the streets, which will allow us to wash streets more easily. Plus we wont have people without housing who need to resort to using the sidewalks and streets to relieve themselves.""

I'm all for public restrooms, as well. Like, public restroom infrastructure SHOULD be as common of a public utility as street signs and lights and crosswalks - but for the sake of this specific conversation, I am looking at solving the problem without actual land use or construction.... just humanpower.

Am I offbase here? Haven't I loosely outlined a path here that any reasonable city official could implement?

First we get the garbage cans.
Then we get cityvacs.
Then we get the street washing.
THEN YOU GET...DA POWAH.

I mean, it would cost $$$ but it would be a jobs program, and would 100% benefit the city. What would be the downside? What am I missing? Are there people who would block this kind of thing simply because they want to solve something else FIRST under the presumption that you can't solve problems concurrently?

It actually prompted me to make my first Yelp and Google reviews, but they were both hidden because it was a new account.  Thought I'd post this here because I saw someone recommend them in a comment a while back, which led me to trying paragliding with them.

&gt; RACISM and BIGOTRY are the two words I would use to describe my paragliding experience at Seattle Paragliding.  All of the quoted words and phrases that follow are directly from the owner, Marc Chirico, during his *""interview""* with me to see if I was the right type of person to learn to paraglide at Seattle Paragliding. To start, Marc considers Seattle Paragliding to be more of a *""fraternity""* than a paragliding school. As such, he is interested in bringing in like-minded people and, to quote Marc, wants to get a bunch of *""alphas""* to hang out with. He explicitly said (multiple times) that he doesn't want any *""snowflakes""* in his little club.
&gt; 
&gt; The day began with an orientation for everyone doing a tandem flight. The first thing that struck me as odd was during this tandem orientation. The bulk of the orientation is Marc laughing at videos of past clients who messed up on their flight (e.g., they fall on take off or vomit in the air). At one point during the orientation, Marc explains how you'll briefly hang in your harness. He described it is *""Hang on your pronouns""*. He seemed to find this quite funny and went around to everyone trying to get them to say the phrase *""hang on your pronouns""*.
&gt; 
&gt; After the flight, I spoke with Marc about the possibility of learning to fly. This is when Marc's *""interview""* occurred. A few Asian women came up to Marc while he was interviewing me. Mid-conversation with them he leaned over to me and mentioned that he would never instruct them because *""he doesn't want to deal with that two language BS""*.

It will take place this Monday, at 7:30 PM at [Optimism Brewing](https://optimismbrewing.com/), 1158 Broadway (except for when the brewery closes for holidays, employee appreciation events, apocalyptic occurrences, etc.).

Start time is typically more like 7:15, as people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. Don't worry if you don't see any games as they'll be brought out soon enough. If you're new, I typically am there in a bright red Seattle Humane shirt as most of the time I'll be coming straight from my volunteer shift (although this isn't always the case). I will also get a reservation for the group so a little placard should be out as well.

In regards to food, Optimism does not have a kitchen but does allow food from outside. They also almost always have a food truck show up every night. [Food truck calendar here](https://optimismbrewing.com/food-trucks). *We ask that you please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ:

Q.) *What kind of games are played? Should I bring mine?*

A.) A whole slew of games are played; from short games like Codenames and Liars Dice, to longer ones like Evolution and Scythe. And feel free to bring your own games, too. You might find some people who are interested in trying it out.

Q.) *I don't really know how to play any board games besides x, y, z.... Will I be welcome here?*

A.) That's completely fine. There are plenty of people who are willing to explain the rules and do quite a good job at it, too.

Q.) *Speaking of being welcome, what kind of people are allowed to attend?*

A.) Everyone is welcome, so long as you are polite, respectful, and considerate of the other patrons. Also know that Optimism is a dog friendly bar, so bring your pup if you'd like. And if you're allergic, be sure to take any medicine before attending.

Q.) *I don't drink alcohol, but want to be supportive of Optimism. How can I still be a good patron?*

A.) Optimism also sells a non alcoholic $1 bubbly, crisp, sparkling water that I have enjoyed before. And if you can't handle any sort of carbonation, then there's no need to buy anything. You can support Optimism in another ways: telling your friends about the venue, grabbing and bussing any glasses someone may have left behind at another table while on your way out, etc.

Q.) *There's another huge board game group there... are you a part of them?*

A.) Nope! That is the Seattle Gaymers group. They're super organized, have a Facebook group, and even have a welcoming table. However, there have been times when someone from their group has mingled with ours and that's been fine.",True,False,False,Seattle,t5_2qhad,469041,public,self,Monday Capitol Hill Board Game Night: 7:30 pm at Optimism,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/wd81v9/monday_capitol_hill_board_game_night_730_pm_at/,all_ads,6,flair,,Meetup,,dark,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'FFPlYVz6CPoG8F8csoqLuKbjY-sCea7KsZrgnvjp44A', 'resolutions': [{'height': 127, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/PyGAH9iOOKcHuFOkNffZ2neCc0pK5kaAyFLgdqo9kU4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f83dc2602d0ddfbcb94acca3680d725b3d006ac', 'width': 108}, {'height': 254, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/PyGAH9iOOKcHuFOkNffZ2neCc0pK5kaAyFLgdqo9kU4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93b4367f24fbc27e59ef94b3d2896d7fffa8584c', 'width': 216}, {'height': 377, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/PyGAH9iOOKcHuFOkNffZ2neCc0pK5kaAyFLgdqo9kU4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed4e7a2e8ae045b0c5e5b7598ce51a9d24d1890', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 615, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/PyGAH9iOOKcHuFOkNffZ2neCc0pK5kaAyFLgdqo9kU4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=43abfc9636b08751c548c5004596b62dc52aa4a1', 'width': 522}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,

We've got a fairly large backyard with alley access in West Seattle, and two large 10x20 tarped metal tent-like structures were there when we purchased the property. They're ugly as heck, and so we've been planning to replace them with an enclosed carport (see karportking.com) of the same dimensions. This thing wouldn't need a slab or any additi9nal construction and would be less than 750 sqft.

It seems like the Seattle permitting process is purposefully difficult and vague, but everything I've read suggests that the type of structure we're thinking should be okay either without a permit or solely a subject to inspection permit. We're planning to put down basically no more than prefabricated poles and sheet metal where a structure already exists, and the install will only take a single day.

In this scenario, is it worth actually waiting out the lengthy permit process, or should we be okay to just proceed with replacing our sheds with this similar carport structure without the city's permission? For what it's worth, it will be largely concealed in our backyard anyways and our neighbors are all very cool.

Hopefully today is the end of this year's heat wave, and we can enjoy the rest of the summer. This cute, upbeat piece is a love song to the *Seattle Summertime* by Seattle-area singer/songwriter and producer [David Perry](https://davidperrytunes.com/). The song recounts the many virtues of city with shout outs to the market, [Seafair](https://www.seafair.org/), the fresh air, and various sports teams. Perry expresses how he'd like us to make the most of the short summer season.

I raised my hand to say hi, in order to state that everything is fine, since there was no one in that place other than him and me (this is a practice some people in my country do). 

Then, harshly, he asked if I was stalking him. Since I am not fluent in English, it took a time to understand the question, so I asked 'What?', and he said, really pissed off, 'Start walking!'.

I, not understanding what was going on, asked 'Why?'. He ignored my question and repeatedly shouted, 'Start walking!'. To avoid confrontation, I said 'Ok' and walked away.

What was my mistake? Greeting a stranger at late night? Did the fact of holding a cigarette in one of my hands somehow created a negative point of view about me? Or my action is something execrable in the American culture?

Now that I’ve learned about SeaFair I’m wondering if it would be best to avoid downtown and the potentially long wait for the ferry and get a car at the airport and drive through Tacoma? Or if there are puddle jumper flights from SeaTac to Port Angeles we would do that too; we don’t necessarily need a car once we get there.

does anyone know of any resources or have any tips on how to track newly leased MFTE vacancies in seattle?

the obvious answer is narrow down the list of buildings i want to live in and check from there... but given housing scarcity, it feels more important to me to find availability than wait around for my ideal apartment to open up.

In the conditions of international isolation and sanctions, Russia is desperately trying to build new military-political blocs - with China and Iran, as well as with satellite countries completely dependent on the Russian Federation (Belarus, North Korea, Syria). Whether Iran will agree to this is an extremely interesting question.

It should be recalled that after the deal concluded in 2015 by the presidents of the United States and Iran - B. Obama and H. Rouhani - the huge tension in the international arena between theocratic Iran and the liberal West subsided significantly. Moreover, the United States lifted only those sanctions that were related to Iran's nuclear program, while the sanctions applied in connection with Iran's support for terrorism, human rights violations and the ballistic missile development program remained in force. But even this format of easing sanctions had a tremendous effect the economy began to develop rapidly, the inflation rate was reduced from 40% to 9%, jobs were created, foreign investment was attracted, in particular, 13 new airliners were purchased (although Iran was able to conclude a contract for the purchase of 200 new aircraft, but did not manage to get them). The positions of the reformers and pro-Western Iranian politicians were greatly strengthened, and society as a whole was open towards Westernization.

Unfortunately, President D. Trump cancelled this deal, returned the sanctions in full and ensured a new flowering of conservatism and religious fundamentalism in Iran. Representatives of the reformers were not even allowed to take part in the next elections, and not the president and parliament but Rahbar (spiritual head) and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps became main political forces again.

The Biden administration has focused entirely on relations with China and on Russia's war against Ukraine. However, Moscow's active flirtations with Beijing and Tehran, of course, are forcing Washington to somehow respond to the possibility of building a new ""axis of evil"" in one configuration or another. For now, the current US administration has made it clear that it is not ready to return to the 2015 deal with Iran, which is connected with the internal confrontation between Republicans and Democrats. But Washington is ready, at least, to discuss with Tehran the conditions for lifting the embargo on Iranian oil.

As for the ties between the Russian Federation and Iran, which lie on the surface, it can be said that V. Putin was brought to Tehran primarily by the the Russian army's urgent need for attack drones (the Russian Federation produces reconnaissance UAVs ""Orlan-10"" itself, although it depends on foreign components). During July this year the Russian delegation visited the Kashan airfield several times, studying the characteristics of the Iranian Shahed-191 and Shahed-129 UAVs. It is known that in 2011, an American MQ-9A Reaper drone crashed in Iraq (partially under the influence of Iran) and an Israeli Hermes-450 crashed in Iran itself. The Iranians dismantled these models and used them to develop / copy the Shahed-129 UAV. In turn, the Shahed-191 drone is a copy of the American RQ-170 Sentinel UAV, which Iran also acquired in 2011.

According to Iranian media, V. Putin asked Tehran for 300 drones. At the same time, according to some military experts, Iran now physically does not have more than 100 strike UAVs. But, of course, the parties could conclude some kind of agreement for the medium term - about the production and gradual transfer of drones by Iran for the Russian army. On the other hand, the US Administration has publicly stated that if such agreements are reached between Moscow and Tehran, the West's international pressure on Iran will be multiplied many times over. In addition, Iran itself is waging proxy wars in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, for which it also needs its strike drones.

So far, all that the Russian Federation and Iran have achieved at the public level is to intensify trade and economic cooperation, increase the number of air travel between the two countries and provide maintenance for Russian aircraft in Iran (which, de facto, will be achieved by using the parts of one serviceable or partially serviceable aircraft to maintain the operation of another).

That is, at the public level, V. Putin's visit to Tehran is more like ritual dances and diplomatic games without any serious obligations. The only hope is that the modest agreements between the two authoritarian states will not be transformed into a new

Our stuff was loaded in Lacey, and all boxes have the last name Yama on them. One truck was spotted in Tacoma and we were able to retrieve the kayaks but the truck was almost empty. 

Please, if you see an abandoned Uhaul up that way the plate number is:

AE40623 (Arizona plate)

So, that being said - it has come to my attention that as of today there doesn't appear to be any stores anywhere in the state that has them anymore and since retail ""seasons"" are 3-6 ahead of the real seasons -- heaters are coming in, so it's unlikely these stores will be getting AC units anytime soon.  (Unless it's some sort of emergency shipment and if that does happen, you can expect those units to be completely sold out within 30 minutes of them hitting the floors.)

That being said, if you waited until now (the end of AC selling season) to go looking for an AC unit, you more than likely are out of luck.  Also, remember -- IT WILL GET HOT AGAIN so KEEP the units instead of throwing them out/returning them.  If a store allows you to return a unit you have used, which is generally not the case, they cannot re-sell that unit and must return it to their Vendors to be destroyed.

If any of you have seen the now elusive AC units at any stores for sale, feel free to let us know in the comments.  Just note that these comments and even the ""on hands"" on websites are sometimes delayed by up to 48 hours -- so even if somewhere online says a store has it and they don't, they likely sold out in the time between you seeing it online and getting to the store.

On the Friday night I got separated from my friends, with no phone, water or jacket lol, and ended up wandering around like a lost soul for hours trying to find them. At the portaloos, I randomly got talking to a girl, called Lakshmi *(possibly spelled incorrectly),* who was extremely friendly and suggested that I head back with her and hang out with her and her bf, Kevin. I ended up hanging with them for quite a while and had such a great laugh. Meeting them picked me out of the rut I was in and was the highlight of my Friday at Shambs.

Both live in Washington but I'm pretty sure Lakshmi said her background is from Cambodia and that Kevin is half Irish and....... I'm not sure what else so I'm going to go with half legend lol...

If anyone in Washington reckons they know who these folks might be I'd greatly appreciate it if you could provide some means of making contact *(preferably email or Insta)* so that I could reach out and thank them. In my intoxicated state I completely forgot to ask for their contact details.

I know it's a long shot but any help/knowledge would be greatly appreciated!! :)

I'm in my early 30s, an avid skier, climber, hiker, and love shooting photos. Also really love going to shows, music in general, coffee, and love a good video game session.

In my current job, if someone steals, it's my responsibility to do something about it. We (and I in particular) are big on de-escalation. In my opinion if someone comes in, steals a bit of food for themselves and doesn't make a fuss then fine. Whatever. I've talked my peers down from making a big deal about it because frankly, once they touch the food (before it's known with certainty they're going to steal it)... even if we recover it, it's getting thrown away so they may as well keep it. But unfortunately they're often also stealing non-essentials ($50 hydroflask and various expensive healthcare stuff).

My current workplace in particular has seen encampments of RVs across the street come and go. When they're there we see a marked uptick of people coming in and causing problems. 

I wish the city had a solution. I truly do. I agree that's it's not enough to just move people along. But I'm not in that position to make that solution and I have to personally deal with the consequences. I have to kick people out who yell at me the entire way out the door. It's clear that they know I can't *actually* do anything to make them leave. I could call the police, but are they going to show up in time (or at all)? Not likely. 

So when someone says ""well where else are they going to go?"" Forgive me if  I don't care. That's not my problem to figure out, but it can't be here. If you're going to accuse me of claiming it's a problem so long as it's in my backyard then open yours up for invitation.

Not all homeless are problematic, of course. But the ones who are, are especially problematic and since I can't determine at a glance which is which... then yeah. Get out of my backyard. If you end up in my neighbors backyard then it's up to them to tell you that you should move on. But again, ideally, the government we've elected should be finding a solution... and that's it's own conversation.  


In the meantime, I'm a bit exhausted dealing with people who steal from my place of employment while refusing to leave and also claiming to own the business I work out (amusing as that is).

I'm someone who grew up in the area who is currently about to go to university elsewhere, and am contemplating my study options. One degree that looked interesting to me was food engineering.

A preliminary search on Google and Linkedin showed me jobs with Starbucks, and then Oberto and Darigold, and a few other companies south of Seattle. However, I'm curious as to whether there is a big enough field of jobs to go around, or if it is too niche in this area.

I’ve been struggling to figure out how to process an encounter I had on the light rail a few months back. It’s bothered me so much I avoid the light rail as much as possible now. Basically on the way back from a flight I road the light rail about half way to my destination someone sits across from me and asks “what are you doing?”. Being kind of introverted this kind of random encounter on a train caught me off guard. I told them I’m riding back from a trip. They accused me of lying and asked why was I following them. Given I was doing nothing but surfing my phone the entire time on the train I wasn’t sure how someone could interpret that. I showed them my phone and showed them my luggage and explained I was just riding back from a trip. This wasn’t good enough and they asked who did I work for and what I wanted. At this point I realized this person wasn’t going to be convinced so I proceeded to get up and walk to the other side of the train. They followed me while yelling at me “how do you like being followed” along with profanities. I tried to tell them I wasn’t following them, and to please leave me alone. The entire train cabin just ignored this like nothing was happening. I tried to get off the next stop, they jumped off with me, so I jumped back on. Finally I started to panic this person might try to get physical with me, and I had no desire for a conflict. I decided I’d call an Uber for the next station and run for it. And basically what I did with the said person yelling at me the whole way until I got out of the station and suddenly they walked away. Needless to say the entire encounter left me on edge for two reasons. One the indifference of everyone else on board and two I have no idea how I could deescalate this. I tried very hard more than I feel appropriate to do so showing content on my own personal device to convince this person I wasn’t stalking them. Calling police wouldn’t been helpful for one there’s no way they would have responded on time. There were 0 staff on the train the entire ride. Does anyone have helpful advice on how to handle these kinds of interactions with mentally with individuals?

**TL;DR: What are restaurants in the greater Seattle area that are good to dress in cocktail/semi-formal attire, while not being expensive?**

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend of \~1.5 years is a big fan of dressing up for dinner dates. When I say “dressing up”, we would wear cocktail/semi-formal attire. For instance, I would wear a button down collared shirt (that is tucked in), dress shoes, slacks, belt, maybe a tie, etc. My girlfriend would wear a dress, heels, etc.

For what its worth, I enjoy dressing up and going out to dinner with my girlfriend too. However I do not enjoy the price point of the restaurants where it is “acceptable” to dress up. Acceptable here meaning that we would not stick out like a sore thumb if we dressed up, compared to what the other restaurant patrons are wearing. For instance, you wouldn’t go to a McDonald’s dressed in semi formal attire.

After living around the country and now Germany – I realize I feel much more at home here than say, TX/NC/SC. 

I also relate much more to people here than most of my countrymen. Which makes sense considering the size, philosophical differences, political autonomy, and geographical differences between our states. 

Bicycles, walking, hiking, public transportation, farmers markets, cafes, weather, geography, arts, festivals, etc. The lifestyle around here feels much more familiar than most places in America I’ve lived in for more than a few months.

This, of course, also makes sense due to the pandemic. 

My question for discussion is, **what do you think of the heightened popularity of hiking in Washington, and are there any solutions?**

I used to go hiking more in the mid-2010s, and less so now because I see it as an ordeal (besides the fact that I'm less fit, lol.) It seems like any hike that has some kind of view / payoff at the end will have a long, long line of cars parked far outside the trailhead, no matter how early you try to show up. Then, you spend most of the trip yielding to other groups / letting people pass you by. I have also noticed more litter and flippant behavior (walking off marked trails, not bagging dog poop, bagging dog poop then leaving it on the trail, etc...) At this point, the quiet trailheads are physically difficult to get to via car and/or don't have much of a ""reward"" at the end.

Washingtonians have always been outdoorsy. My intention is not to gatekeep our state's natural beauty from anyone. I am glad that we are able to fund trail projects and maintenance with the sale of so many recreation passes. Besides the unparalleled natural scenery that we have, we also have a city that is undeniably booming with economic opportunities, which understandably leads to a population boom that wants to get out and explore it all.

But I wonder if there is any way to improve the average hiker's experience, as well as the capacity of trails themselves. Heightened education and signage about outdoor etiquette / land stewardship? More economic control measures to limit traffic to hotspot trails (although I could see that one going off the rails?)

Bainbridge-Seattle has virtually always has a ~30 minute wait, and still does.  I understand it has a heavier amount of traffic, but the other ferries are busy too, especially with the rise of people moving out of the city. It seems ridiculous to prioritize such a short route and leave Edmonds-Kingston, Bremerton-Seattle, and other routes with 2+ hour waits (if you're lucky!), especially when so many riders are daily commuters who can't afford to live within Seattle limits or on Bainbridge.  Busy or not, there's a huge discrepancy between a 30 minute wait that continues to receive priority focus and the ever-growing wait times of other ferries that can't support increasing populations. It's hopeless for commuters, triples the time of already-long travel times, and ruins the plans of literally everyone who can't afford the extra gas to drive around to Bainbridge.

As someone who frequently rides several different ferries (both walkon and driving), this system feels so broken.

They took both my laptops, all my monitors, 3 external hard drives with my life's work, clothes, kitchware, broke a few windows, everything. I didn't have renter's insurance.

2nd time was in Longview. They took my purse right out from under my feet on the bus. Thought I was being smart by having it secured around my leg, guess it wasn't that secure. I had 3 gift cards in it worth $200 each, plus the cost of replacing my ID, the bag itself, my phone (which was essentially worthless) Roughly a $700 loss.

3rd time was in Seattle, they broke into my car. Estimated loss $500 in repairs.

4th time was Saturday night. This was on me, (I guess they're all on me in one way or another). I don't know if I dropped my wallet or they slipped it out of my huge jacket that I was wearing. Estimated loss $700 in cash (included $150 I just put on my orca card, $200 gift card, cash, and cost of replacing ID; hopefully all they fraudulent charges on my cards will be reversed).

Maybe I just give off victim vibes that people like to target, maybe since starting antidepressants my mind is a little foggy and I'm less aware of my surroundings, maybe since deciding to do this big move and start over after my partner and I called it quits has proved that I'm incapable of surviving on my own. I don't know. Probably a combination of everything. But at a certain point, this comes down to the decisions I'm making and how I operate. 

Maybe I'm not skilled enough to live in Portland or Seattle as they struggle with extreme homelessness and crime, while simultaneously being excessively expensive places to live.

It will take place every Monday, at 7:30 PM at [Optimism Brewing](https://optimismbrewing.com/), 1158 Broadway (except for when the brewery closes for holidays, employee appreciation events, apocalyptic occurrences, etc.).

Start time is typically more like 7:15, as people tend to show up then to order food, chat, etc. Don't worry if you don't see any games as they'll be brought out soon enough. If you're new, I typically am there in a bright red Seattle Humane shirt as most of the time I'll be coming straight from my volunteer shift (although this isn't always the case). I will also get a reservation for the group so a little placard should be out as well.

In regards to food, Optimism does not have a kitchen but does allow food from outside. They also almost always have a food truck show up every night. [Food truck calendar here](https://optimismbrewing.com/food-trucks). *We ask that Please order something, even if it's just one beverage. Optimism is a public bar, and we need to respect their business needs.*

FAQ:

Q.) *What kind of games are played? Should I bring mine?*

A.) A whole slew of games are played; from short games like Codenames and Liars Dice, to longer ones like Evolution and Scythe. And feel free to bring your own games, too. You might find some people who are interested in trying it out.

Q.) *I don't really know how to play any board games besides x, y, z.... Will I be welcome here?*

A.) That's completely fine. There are plenty of people who are willing to explain the rules and do quite a good job at it, too.

Q.) *Speaking of being welcome, what kind of people are allowed to attend?*

A.) Everyone is welcome, so long as you are polite, respectful, and considerate of the other patrons. Also know that Optimism is a dog friendly bar, so bring your pup if you'd like. And if you're allergic, be sure to take any medicine before attending.

Q.) *I don't drink alcohol, but want to be supportive of Optimism. How can I still be a good patron?*

A.) Optimism also sells a non alcoholic $1 bubbly, crisp, sparkling water that I have enjoyed before. And if you can't handle any sort of carbonation, then there's no need to buy anything. You can support Optimism in another ways: telling your friends about the venue, grabbing and bussing any glasses someone may have left behind at another table while on your way out, etc.

Q.) *There's another huge board game group there... are you a part of them?*

A.) Nope! That is the Seattle Gaymers group. They're super organized, have a Facebook group, and even have a welcoming table.

Things I heard that are must see are Mt Rainier park, Olympic forest, flight museum, Chihuly garden, space needle. we plan to visit vancouver for a day on Monday. any advise from long time Seattle Seahawks fans on how to plan this trip? am thinking like after we pick up our rental car, have some breakfast and head straight to site seeing..like mt rainier park maybe spend as much as we can and head to hotel by 5pm, visit olympic national forest next day? can we see Chihuly garden, space needle, flight museum on Tuesday? if we leave early on Monday and reach Vancouver by 11 or noon, what are the few things we can see before we head back to Dupont by say 10pm. appreciate your suggestions.

I have probably spent over $2k in accessories, materials, etc to try and create a quiet environment for myself.

Everything I've tried up until now has been what you might call insulation though, which doesn't work that well and is a PITA to implement properly, especially in a leased unit. I also don't want to have to wear noise-cancelling headphones 24/7 and I can't do that while I sleep anyway. Earplugs alone don't cut it at night.

So, I'm planning to buy a nice set of wireless speakers and lay them around the unit, synced up and blasting white noise and low BPM music 24/7. If I make it loud enough, it should drown out any noise that's coming from through the walls and I will be, in theory, a happy camper.

I'm not going to be blasting like EDM or anything like that, just really, really loud white noise and maybe lofi hiphop. I'm going to make it as loud as is safe and comfortable for me while still being able to block the noise though.

I can hear noises from my neighbors during all hours of the day and night, so I have no sympathy for them, but can they actually do anything about what I'm planning to do? Will the police care if called? Are there grounds for eviction if I get a lot of complaints and refuse to stop? What if I only play the white noise during quiet hours but it's still really loud?

I have just been dealing with noises for far too long and I'm done playing the nice guy. It's not realistic to try to talk to the neighbors and expect the desired outcome, and the property staff are complicit. This is my last resort.

I’m a recent transplant to Seattle from Kansas City for work. While I love Seattle, always have, the state of homelessness is something I’m going to have to get used to. It’s crazy to me how one moment you can be on a pleasant street and then suddenly in an apocalyptic wasteland (then back to another pleasant street).

Anyway, while not many homeless people actually approach/acknowledge me, some do, and the midwesterner in me makes it difficult to ignore them. Two questions…

Say that you’re sitting at the front of the Link next to a group of locals and a “zombie” (you know the type). The “zombie” (hope that’s not an offensive term, by the way) seems particularly interested in you and makes uncomfortable comments or something. The back of the Link is empty. Do you get off the Link, move to the back of the Link, or stay put since you’re close to the driver and the group of people?

Also, I came up with the zombie term after seeing a guy walking in the middle of the street aimlessly and yelling at the voices in his head. I noticed that the tourists got nervous, but the locals stayed cool like nothing was happening— walked right by him. Are these guys ever dangerous? Do you just get used to them?

Any other tips would be freaking amazing.
